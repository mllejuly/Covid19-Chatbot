What are schistosomes?,"Schistosomes are worms. There are 2 major forms of schistosomiasis – intestinal and urogenital – caused by 5 main species of blood fluke. Table: Parasite species and geographical distribution of schistosomiasis SpeciesGeographical distributionIntestinal
 schistosomiasisSchistosoma mansoniAfrica, the Middle East, the Caribbean, Brazil, Venezuela and Suriname
             Schistosoma japonicumChina, Indonesia, the Philippines Schistosoma mekongiSeveral districts of Cambodia and the Lao People’s Democratic Republic  Schistosoma guineensis
 and related S. intercalatumRain forest areas of central AfricaUrogenital schistosomiasisSchistosoma haematobiumAfrica, the Middle East, Corsica (France)"
How do I get schistososmiasis?,"A person infected with urinary schistosomaisis will have parasite eggs in their urine.A person infected with intestinal schistosomaisis will have parasite eggs in their faeces.In areas where there is no proper latrine system, freshwater 
sources around the village become contaminated with faeces or urine 
containing the worm eggs.In the water the eggs hatch and then they must find a particular type of snail.The snail acts like a mini photocopier and releases thousands of infective larvae.When people come in contact with the water, these larvae penetrate the skin.Children who spend a lot of time playing and swimming in the 
water are particularly vulnerable, as are fishermen and women carrying 
out household chores like washing."
How do I avoid getting schistosomiasis?,"Avoid swimming or other contact with fresh water lakes, rivers, or 
irrigation channels in areas where schistosomiasis is known to be 
transmitted (see Geographical distribution)."
What are the symptoms of schistosomiasis?,"Urinary Schistosomaisis: If you have been in an 
area where urinary schistosomiasis is transmitted, and then you see 
blood in your urine, treat for schistosomiasis first of all.Intestinal Schistosomaisis: The symptoms for 
intestinal schistosomiasis are much more nonspecific and can be caused 
by other diseases as well: they include diarrhoea, lethargy and 
tiredness, abdominal pain or discomfort, and blood in the faeces."
"If I think I have schistosomiasis, how do I treat it?","There is only one drug for the treatment of schistosomiasis, which is called praziquantel.The dose is calculated according to your weight (see table below).Children under 5 years are unlikely to have much contact with 
water and are therefore unlikely to be heavily infected. From the age of
 about 6 years onwards, children learn to swim and play in water and as a
 result are much more at risk.   Table: Drug to treat schistosomiasisBody weight (Kg)N°. of praziquantel tablets  (600mg tablet) 10.0–14.9 1 15.0–22.4 1 1/222.5–29.9230.0–37.42 1/237.5–44.9345.0–59.9460.0–75.05"
"If I am pregnant, is it safe to take the drugs to treat schistosomiasis?","Yes, the drug is extremely safe and WHO recommends that if you 
have schistosomiasis, you should be treated, even if you are pregnant.As a general precaution, WHO recommendations state that all drugs should be taken after the first trimester."
1. Can I submit a full project proposal through WHO?,"Project proposals are submitted through a GCF Accredited Entity (AE). WHO is not yet a GCF AE and as such full project proposals cannot be submitted through WHO.WHO can assist with the development of full project proposals for submission to GCF and this activity can be funded through the Readiness programme. WHO can also be engaged to implement activities as part of a GCF-funded project, however, an AE is responsible for project proposal submission and then managing the overall project.The full list of GCF accredited entities are on the GCF website. Learn more about the support WHO can offer through the GCF Readiness Programme here."
2. What if I am unable to find an appropriate Accredited Entity to submit a health-related GCF project proposal?,The GCF is available to assist if you are unable to find an Accredited Entitiy (AE). The Nationally Designated Authority (NDA) should contact their regional GCF focal points. (Please see contact details below).
3. What are the key impacts to be demonstrated for an adaptation project proposal?,"The GCF documents, Initial Investment framework: activity-specific subcriteria and indicative assessment factors and Mitigation and Adaptation performance measurement frameworks, provides some guidance and examples of assessment factors for both mitigation and adaptation projects."
4. Where can I find examples of successful GCF project proposals?,All successful project proposals are available on the GCF website. Other background and guidance documents can also be found on these pages.
5. What are some key tips for developing a GCF project proposal for health?,"Ensure the NDA is engaged and supportive from the beginningShare the draft concept note early with the GCF and WHODevelop a clear theory of change for your projectGCF Project Preparation Facility (PPF) could provide financial support to Accredited Entities to develop a Funding Proposal from project Concept Note;Technical assistance is available to assist Direct Access Entities and NDAs for strengthening Concept Notes and PPF applications.  The technical assistance is not deployed however, to write the PPF proposal or the CN.  The technical assistance is there to provide guidance to help the NDA team or the DAE to write their own concept or PPF proposal."
1. What can WHO do as a GCF Readiness Delivery Partner?,"Readiness Delivery Partners provide services such as: development of readiness request proposals; implementation and supervision; financial management; progress reporting; and project completion and evaluation.WHO can to support countries in developing readiness proposals and implementing readiness activities for health such as conducting a health vulnerability and adaptation assessment, developing the health component of the national adaptation plan (H-NAP), assessing the health co-benefits of mitigation, the development of a full project proposal or any other health priority issues as agreed with the NDA.WHO can assist with the development of full project proposals for submission to GCF. WHO can also implement activities as part of a GCF-funded project, however, an Accredited Entity (AE) can only be responsible for project proposal submission and then managing the overall project. WHO is currently not an AE of the GCF."
2. What is the funding cap for WHO as a Readiness Delivery Partner?,"Funding caps are applied depending on the results of the Financial Management Capacity Assessment (FMCA) where the track record of the delivery partner is analyzed. Currently, there is no funding cap for WHO as a Delivery Partner, so for any project for which WHO is a delivery partner the funding caps for that country will apply."
3. Who needs to submit the GCF readiness proposal?,"The readiness proposal must be submitted by the country’s National Designated Authority (NDA) and as such, it is very important to have the support of the NDA at an early stage. It is equally important to ensure that the proposal is developed in partnership with the Ministry of Health (or the equivalent government department) and other relevant government counterparts.For proposals in which WHO is the delivery partner, WHO HQ is the appropriate contact point for section 1.4 of the readiness template. The information to be provided is as follows:World Health OrganizationMs Elena Villalobos PratsTechnical Officer, Health and Climate Change Unit+41 22 791 2465"
"4. If WHO HQ is the readiness delivery partner, who will receive the funds?","Upon approval of a readiness proposal, WHO HQ will receive funds directly from the Green Climate Fund. These funds can then be transferred to the WHO country office, depending on the implementation plan of the proposal and approval by the GCF. Funds are not transferred to the country's government directly."
5. Who is responsible for the implementation of approved readiness activities?,"The role of a delivery partner of any approved readiness activities is the implementation of the said activities. Hence, if WHO is the selected and approved readiness delivery partner for that specific proposal, WHO will be responsible for ensuring the activities are implemented as outlined in the proposal.  However, to ensure effective delivery of proposal activities it is crucial that the proposal is developed in partnership with the Ministry of Health (or equivalent Government department) and the NDA."
6. What are the first steps in developing a GCF readiness proposal?,"As a starting point for GCF readiness proposal development, please consider the following steps (these steps are provided as a suggestion, the actual process will depend on the country context):Identify the needs of the health sector in relation to climate change. If your country’s action plans have been already established, such plans could serve a good reference point;Review the with the GCF Readiness and Preparatory Support Guidebook to match your country needs with eligible activities for the Readiness Programme;In partnership with the Ministry of Health (MoH) formulate the needs and categorize them into one or more of the five relevant funding objectives listed above;With the MoH, inform your NDA that WHO is now a delivery partner of Readiness Programme and communicate the identified needs to the NDA;Undertake a trilateral discussion between NDA, WHO and GCF Secretariat (Regional Officers in DCP) on the potential proposal. This communication should be ongoing throughout the proposal development process;Determine the NDA’s interest in the proposed activities and, with the MoH, discuss the opportunity for WHO to access readiness funds could be accessed as a delivery partner;Check with the NDA the availability of readiness funds under the two funding options, considering other readiness proposals that have been submitted or are under development;Complete the required documentation (listed in the readiness proposal template) in partnership with MoH and any other partners and provide to the NDA for submission."
7. What are the deadlines for submitting a readiness proposal?,"For access to the USD 1 million per year (ie. all non-NAP or H-NAP proposals) there are submission cycles with the following deadlines:2nd submission cycle deadline: 31 March 20203rd submission cycle deadline: 30 June 20204th submission cycle      deadline: 31 August 2020     The submission cycles are only indicative timelines for GCF and the approval of the proposal is subject to the quality of submission. The final 4th submission cycle deadline is the final deadline to submit proposals to be eligible to be counted against the 2020 Readiness cap. The Secretariat will make every effort to process, review, and approve Readiness proposals submitted by the 31 August deadline to fall under 2020 Readiness caps. Proposals will be counted against the annual cap for 2020 or 2021 according to the date they are approved, not the date they are submitted."
8. Does the funding for a GCF readiness proposal count towards the funding limit of the submission year or the approval year?,"The funding for a readiness proposal counts towards the funding limit of the year the proposal is approved. For example, if a country submits a readiness proposal in June 2020 but it is not approved until January 2021, the funding will be part of the USD 1 million cap for 2021."
9. Can you engage multiple delivery partners for a readiness project?,"No, there must be a lead delivery partner that is responsible for the project. However, where further expertise and/or services are required, other partners may be engaged through established, transparent procurement processes."
How do I protect my health in a flood?,"Since floods can potentially increase the transmission of water- and vector-borne diseases, such as typhoid fever, cholera, malaria, and yellow fever, among others, it is important to know your risk and protect your water sources. The most common risks associated with flooding is the contamination of drinking-water facilities, and standing water, which can be a breeding site for mosquitoes, bring chemical hazards, and cause injuries.
Protect your health during a flood by:

Knowing your community’s evacuation route and warning signals, and identifying areas prone to flooding or landslides.
Chlorinating or boiling all water for drinking and food preparation
    Ensuring uninterrupted provision of safe drinking water is the most important preventive measure to be implemented following flooding, in order to reduce the risk of outbreaks of water-borne diseases.
    
Promoting good hygienic practices and safe food preparation techniques
    Do not use flood water to wash dishes, brush teeth or wash and prepare food. Always wash your hands with soap and water if you have been in contact with floodwater.
Avoiding walking or driving through flooded areas and standing water.
    Even the smallest amount of water can bring about significant dangers. You do not know if electrical lines have fallen in the water or hazardous chemicals exist. Cars and people can easily be swept away during a flood.
    
Throwing away any food that has come in contact with floodwater.
    If your food has touched any floodwater, it is not safe to eat and increases your risk of water-borne diseases.
    
Safely cleaning your home if it has come in contact with floodwater.
    Throw out any items that cannot be washed and cleaned with bleach, such as pillows and mattresses. Clean all walls, floors and other surfaces with soap and water, as well as bleach.
    
Protect against mosquitos
    If your home is in an area with stagnant or standing water, use mosquito repellent, following the instructions on the label, and apply it to clothes or skin. Also wear trousers and long-sleeved shirts, and cover beds with mosquito nets when sleeping.

Five Keys to Safer Food"
How do statistics improve health?,"Countries need health statistics in order to identify why 
people die or what causes illness or injury. This information enables 
countries to target their health problems and prioritize the use of 
precious health resources.Every year WHO analyses data from its 194 Member States and 
produces burden of disease and mortality health estimates, which are 
published in the ""World health statistics"". These estimates are a report
 card of global health. They tell us, for example, that risks to health 
are changing. Fewer people are dying from infectious diseases in low- 
and middle-income countries but more people are suffering from chronic 
diseases due to changing patterns of physical activity and consumption 
of alcohol, tobacco and food. These countries now suffer from a double 
burden of chronic, non-communicable conditions as well as the diseases 
that traditionally affect the poor."
How does WHO collect statistics?,"WHO statistics are generated from multiple sources using a 
variety of data collection methods, including household surveys, routine
 reporting by health services, civil registration and censuses and 
disease surveillance systems.In estimating country figures, WHO applies methods of analysis
 that improve data quality and ensure transparency in the application of
 the adjustments that are needed to make the data more comparable across
 countries and over time. (Data that are comparable have been generated 
using the same or similar methods, for similar populations and time 
periods, using standard definitions).WHO is working with countries to improve the quality of health
 information. Currently, WHO receives cause-of-death statistics 
regularly from only about 100 Member States.. Globally, two-thirds (38 
million) of 56 million annual deaths are not registered. WHO makes its data and analyses accessible through the Global 
Health Observatory portal as well as databases that provide statistics 
on a wide range of diseases and health indicators. Related linksGlobal Health Observatory"
Are e-cigarettes and other vaping products dangerous?,"There are many different types of e-cigarettes.  E-cigarettes are the most common form of electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) and electronic non-nicotine delivery systems (ENNDS) but there are others, such as e-cigars, e-pipes, etc. ENDS contain varying amounts of nicotine and harmful emissions.E-cigarette emissions typically contain nicotine and other toxic substances that are harmful to both users, and non-users who are exposed to the aerosols secondhand. Some products claiming to be nicotine-free have been found to contain nicotine.Evidence reveals that these products are harmful to health and are not safe. However, it is too early to provide a clear answer on the long-term impact of using them or being exposed to them. They are particularly risky when used by children and adolescents. Nicotine is highly addictive and young people’s brains develop up to their mid-twenties. Exposure to nicotine of children and adolescents can have long-lasting, damaging effects on brain development and there is risk of nicotine addiction. Furthermore, there is a growing body of evidence in some settings that never-smoker minors who use ENDS at least double their chance of starting to smoke conventional tobacco cigarettes later in life. ENDS use increases the risk of heart disease and lung disorders.  They also pose significant risks to pregnant women who use them, as they can damage the growing fetus.ENDS also expose non-smokers and bystanders to nicotine and other harmful chemicals.Exposure of children to ENDS liquid continues to pose serious risks. There is a risk of the devices leaking, or of children swallowing the liquid, and ENDS have been known to cause serious injuries, including burns, through fires and explosions."
Do e-cigarettes (ENDS) cause lung injuries?,"There is growing evidence that ENDS could be associated with lung injuries and in recent times e-cigarette and vaping have been linked to an outbreak of lung injury in the USA.  This is described by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as ‘e-cigarette or vaping associated lung injury’ (EVALI), which led the CDC to activate an emergency investigation into EVALI on 17 September 2019. The CDC says “as of 14 January 2020, there have been a total of 2,668 cases of EVALI reported from all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the US Virgin Islands, including 60 deaths confirmed in 27 states and the District of Columbia. Among 2,022 hospitalized cases with information on substances used, 1,650 (82%) reported using any THC-containing product, and 1,162 (57%) reported using any nicotine-containing product; 669 (33%) reported exclusive THC-containing product use, and 274 (14%) reported exclusive nicotine-containing product use.”  Further information on this incident, including a strong link of the EVALI outbreak to Vitamin E Acetate and the latest report, is available at https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/basic_information/e-cigarettes/severe-lung-disease.html, which is updated every week, as the evidence is not sufficient to exclude the contribution of other chemicals. At least five other countries have initiated investigations to identify cases of lung injuries related to the EVALI cases reported in the US."
Are e-cigarettes more or less dangerous than conventional tobacco cigarettes?,"It is difficult to generalize on the risk to health of ENDS as compared with cigarettes or other tobacco products, as this is contingent on a range of factors.Both tobacco products and ENDS pose risks to health.  The safest approach is not to use either.The levels of risk associated with using ENDS and/or tobacco products are likely to depend on a range of factors, some relating to the products used
    and some to the individual user. Factors include: product type and characteristics, how the products are used, including frequency of use, how the products are manufactured, who is using the product, and whether product characteristics are manipulated
    post-sale.Toxicity is not the only factor in considering risk to an individual or a population from exposure to ENDS emissions. These factors may include the potential for abusing or manipulating the product, use by children and adolescents
    who otherwise would not have used cigarettes, simultaneous use with other tobacco products (dual or poly use) and children and adolescents going on to use smoked products following experimentation with ENDS.  Further, not all ENDS are the same
    and the risks to health may differ from one product to another, and from user to user."
Are ENDS addictive?,"ENDS contain nicotine, which is highly addictive, and ENDS use involves the inhalation of a nicotine-infused aerosol."
Are secondhand ENDS emissions dangerous?,The aerosols generated by ENDS typically contain toxic substances. ENDS pose risks to both users and non-users.
What are the policy options for regulating ENDS?,"How a country approaches ENDS will depend on factors particular to its situation. ENDS are currently banned in over 30 countries worldwide. In others they are regulated as consumer products, as pharmaceutical products, as tobacco products, other categories or totally unregulated. Where they are not banned, WHO recommends that ENDS be regulated. Regulatory objectives include: Preventing initiation of ENDS use by non-smokers and children, such as by preventing or restricting advertising, promotion and sponsorship, and restricting flavours that appeal to children  Minimizing as far as possible potential health and/or risks to ENDS users, such as by regulating product characteristics Protecting non-users from exposure to their emissions, such as by prohibiting ENDS use in indoor spaces where smoking is not permittedPreventing unproven health claimsProtecting public health policies from commercial and other vested interests"
What role do ENDS play in smoking cessation?,"The scientific evidence regarding the effectiveness of ENDS as a smoking cessation aid is still being debated. To date, in part due to the diversity of ENDS products and the low certainty surrounding many studies, the potential for ENDS to play a role as a population-level tobacco cessation intervention is unclear. To truly help tobacco users quit and to strengthen global tobacco control, governments need to scale up policies and interventions that we know work. Tried and tested interventions, such as brief advice from health professionals, national toll free quit lines and cessation interventions delivered via mobile text messaging is recommended. Where economically feasible, governments should also consider promoting nicotine replacement therapies and non-nicotine pharmacotherapies for cessation."
What is WHO doing about ENDS?,"WHO regularly monitors and reviews the evidence on ENDS and health and offers guidance to governments. This includes the biennial WHO Report on the Global Tobacco Epidemic, which tracks the status of the tobacco epidemic and interventions to combat it and other relevant resources. WHO strives to build a safer, healthier world for everyone, everywhere."

1. What is the GCF Readiness Programme?,"The Readiness Programme is a funding mechanism of the Green Climate Fund (GCF) that is aimed at enhancing country ownership and access to the GCF.  Readiness activities emphasize strengthening institutional capacities of National Designated Authorities (NDAs) or focal points and Direct Access Entities to efficiently engage with GCF. It also assists countries in undertaking adaptation planning and developing strategic frameworks to build their programmatic work with GCF.There are five objectives for the Readiness Programme, and activities proposed under this programme must contribute to one or more of these objectives:I.  Capacity buildingII.  Strategic frameworksIII.  Pipeline developmentIV.  Knowledge sharing and learningV.  Adaptation planningIt is recommended to become familiar with the GCF ‘Readiness and Preparatory Support Guidebook’ and related templates, particularly the GCF readiness proposal template and related templates."
2. Who can access the GCF Readiness Programme?,"All developing country parties to the UNFCCC can access the Readiness Programme, and GCF aims at least 50 per cent of the readiness support goes to particularly vulnerable countries, including Least Developed Countries (LDCs), Small Island Developing States (SIDS) and African States."
3. How much funding is available under the GCF Readiness Programme?,"The GCF Readiness Programme provides:Up to USD 1 million per country per year for support related to institutional capacity building, coordination, policy and planning, and programming for investment. Of this overall amount, Nationally Designated Authorities (NDAs) or Focal Points may request up to USD 300,000 per year in direct support to help establish or strengthen a NDA or focal point to deliver on the Fund’s requirements. A maximum of USD 100,000 can be used for NDA-led stakeholder meetings.Up to USD 3 million per country for the formulation of National Adaptation Plans (NAPs) and/or other adaptation planning processes. This may include support for subnational adaptation plans and/or sectoral adaptation planning processes including H-NAPs It is possible to apply for both the USD 1 million per year and the readiness funds of USD 3 million per year at the same time. The USD 3 million is a one-time funding allocation available for NAP-related activities (including the development of an H-NAP). NDAs may have multiple readiness grants under implementation simultaneously with different delivery partners."
4. Are readiness projects intended to be regional or country-specific?,Readiness proposals can be developed and submitted at country level or at regional level depending on the context-specific needs of the country/ies. Nationally Designated Authorities (NDAs) may have multiple readiness grants under implementation simultaneously and countries can participate in both regional and country level readiness projects (without exceeding the funding caps).
5. Is there a division between mitigation and adaptation activities in terms of funding for readiness?,"No, there are currently no specific funding targets for mitigation/adaptation for readiness. Readiness strongly emphasizes the development of country capacity."
What is lymphatic filariasis?,"Lymphatic filariasis, commonly known as elephantiasis, is a painful and profoundly disfiguring parasitic disease. In communities where the parasite is transmitted, all ages are affected. While the infection may be acquired during childhood its visible manifestations may occur later in life, causing temporary or permanent disability. In endemic countries, lymphatic filariasis has a major social and economic impact."
What causes lymphatic filariasis?,"The disease is caused by three species of thread-like nematode worms, known as filariae – Wuchereria bancrofti (responsible of 90% of the cases), Brugia malayi and Brugia timori. Male worms are about 3–4 centimetres in length, and female worms 8–10 centimetres. The male and female worms together form “nests” in the human lymphatic system, the network of nodes and vessels that maintain the delicate fluid balance between blood and body tissues. The lymphatic system is an essential component of the body’s immune system."
How is the parasite transmitted?,"Adult male and female worms lodge in the lymphatics. Fecund females release larvae (microfilaria) which periodically circulate in the blood. Microfilaria circulating in the blood can be ingested by feeding mosquito vectors. Microfilaria must mature in the vector before becoming infective. The mosquitoes can then spread infective larvae to new hosts when feeding.The major vectors of W. bancrofti are mosquitoes of the genus Culex (in urban and semi-urban areas), Anopheles (in rural areas of Africa and elsewhere) and Aedes (in islands of the Pacific)."
Where is lymphatic filariasis most commonly found?,"An estimated 120 million people in tropical and subtropical areas of the world are infected with lymphatic filariasis. Of the total population requiring preventative chemotherapy to interrupt the transmission cycle, 57% live in the South-East Asia Region (9 countries) and 37% live in the African Region (35 countries)."
What are the signs and symptoms of lymphatic filariasis?,"Filarial infection can cause a variety of clinical manifestations, including lymphoedema of the limbs, genital disease (hydrocele, chylocele, and swelling of the scrotum and penis) and recurrent acute attacks, which are extremely painful and are accompanied by fever. The vast majority of infected people are asymptomatic, but virtually all of them have subclinical lymphatic damage and as many as 40% have kidney damage, with proteinuria and haematuria."
6. Can readiness funding be used to develop a full GCF project proposal?,"No, readiness funding cannot be used for development of a GCF project proposal. However, under the readiness programme activities can be conducted that contribute to project development such as concept notes, pre-feasibility studies, sectoral baseline assessments, mitigation potential assessments, vulnerability and impact assessments and sectoral investment action plans. Readiness activities can also include the development of prioritization methodologies, establishment of MRV frameworks and implantation of climate finance budget protocols."
For whom is this tool useful?,"The tool is useful for policy makers, programme planners and managers, the donor community, advocates for FGM abandonment and anyone interested in learning more about the impact of FGM on health and economies."
How do you hope that countries will use this tool?,This tool can be considered an advocacy tool—demonstrating to countries the positive economic impacts of ending FGM. FGM accounts for on average 9% and up to 30% of the current health expenditures per capita in the 27 included countries.
How were the costs calculated?,"The increased health risks associated with FGM were calculated using the best available scientific evidence. 
Health conditions which have a statistically significant increased risk were included in this analysis. 
Costs of treating  health complications were calculated using standard methods (WHO OneHealth Tool) and (WHO guidance and tools on treatment of health complications of FGM ),
and these costs were applied according to demographic data in each country to arrive at current costs and to project cost savings in  each of those countries."
What information can this tool give?,"The tool allows the user to choose to visualize data by country on the costs associated with health complications of FGM over a woman’s lifetime. It shows how much money can be saved if FGM is prevented – both for now, and for future generations. Users can see the impact of investing in the prevention of FGM both for particular countries and also globally."
How is lymphatic filariasis diagnosed?,There are two methods to diagnose the disease. One can either detect the presence of circulating microfilariae in the blood by examining thick smears (20–60 μl) of finger-prick blood. Blood must be collected at a specific time – either at night or during the day – depending on the periodicity of the microfilariae.The second possibility is to detect Wuchereria bancrofti (the parasite) antigen in human blood samples using the rapid diagnostic test Alere Filariasis Test Strip.
Can lymphatic filariasis be cured?,"All people with filariasis who have microfilaraemia or a positive antigen test should receive antifilarial drug treatment to eliminate microfilariae. Unfortunately, the medicines available have limited effect on adult worms. Treatment also requires managing morbidity and preventing disabilities for affected people."
Can lymphatic filariasis be prevented?,Avoidance of mosquito bites through personal protection measures or community-level vector control and participation in MDA (Mass Drug Administration) at the community level is the best option to prevent lymphatic filariasis.The primary goal of treating affected communities is to eliminate microfilariae from the blood of infected individuals in order to interrupt transmission of infection by mosquitoes. Studies have shown that > 5 years of MDA with preventive chemotherapy reduces microfilariae from the bloodstream and prevents the spread of microfilariae to mosquitoes.
What is the difference between lymphatic filariasis and podoconiosis?,"Podoconiosis is a type of tropical lymphoedema clinically distinguished from lymphatic filariasis through being ascending and commonly bilateral but asymmetric. Evidence suggests that podoconiosis is the result of a genetically determined abnormal inflammatory reaction to mineral particles in irritant red clay soils derived from volcanic deposits. It is a non-parasitic disease.It is mostly found in highland areas of tropical Africa, Central America and north-west India. Like lymphatic filariasis, podoconiosis results in impairments due to lymphoedema. As is the case for lymphatic filariasis, a basic package of care can alleviate suffering and prevent further progression of disease and disability."
Can you explain what exactly is ‘super gonorrhea’?,"We have heard a lot about ‘super gonorrhea’ this year. Basically, when 
we say ‘super gonorrhea’ we mean ‘gonorrhea superbug’. These are extensively drug-resistant gonorrhea with high-level resistance
 to the current recommended treatment for gonorrhea (ceftriaxone and 
azithromycin) including resistance to penicillin, sulphonamides, 
tetracycline, fluoroquinolones, macrolides. Gonorrhea “superbug” had 
been reported by several countries including France, Japan and Spain, 
and this year also in UK and Australia."
What is the current situation of gonorrhea and resistance to current treatment to gonorrhea?,"Neisseria gonorrhoeae
 is the second most common bacterial sexually transmitted infection 
(STI) and results in substantial morbidity and a huge economic cost 
worldwide. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that in 2012, 78 million new cases occurred among adolescents and adults aged 15–49 years worldwide
 with a global incidence rate of 19 per 1000 females and 24 per 1000 
males, with the highest number of incidences occurring the WHO Western 
Pacific and African Regions.1 Antimicrobial
 resistance (AMR) in gonorrhea actually appeared shortly after the 
introduction of antimicrobials at the beginning of the 20th 
century. Resistance has continued to expand since then. In countries 
where appropriate and quality-assured surveillance is in place, there 
are rising trends in decreased susceptibility and increased resistance 
in N. gonorrhoeae to the “last line” of antibiotics (cefixime and ceftriaxone)."
What is causing resistance to gonorrhea?,"There are really 5 reasons for the rise of resistant gonorrhea. Unrestricted access to antimicrobialsInappropriate selection and overuse of antibioticsSuboptimal quality of antibiotics Inherent genetic mutations within the organism which have contributed to the development of a pattern of resistance in N. gonorrhoeae Extra
 genital infections – anorectal and pharyngeal – particularly affect key
 populations such as men who have sex with men. This may also play an 
important role in the development of resistant strains as N. gonorrhoeae interacts and exchanges genetic material with other co-infections in these anatomical sites"
"As levels of AMR and resistance infections are on the rise globally, should we expect to see an increase in resistance to other STIs? Is it possible that we will have ‘super’ syphilis or ‘super’ chlamydia in the near future?","Yes, there are risks that resistance could 
be seen in other STIs. In fact, we’re already seeing it.  Although the 
first line treatment of Benzathine penicillin remains highly effective, 
there has been evidence of resistance to azithromycin, commonly used as 
an alternative treatment for syphilis and other common infections.  There have been no reported cases of ‘super’ syphilis. There is, however, increasing resistance to Mycoplasma genitalium, a common STI that causes urethral discharge, and a common symptom for gonorrhea and chlamydial infection as well. Luckily, there have been no reports yet of resistance to the treatment of chlamydia."
What happens if gonorrhea is not treated effectively (untreatable)?,"When we talk about the risks of ineffectively-treated gonococcal infections, there are really three main areas of concern.Reproductive ImplicationsGonococcal infections have critical implications to reproductive, maternal and newborn health including:a five-fold increase of HIV transmissioninfertility, with its cultural and social implicationsinflammation, leading to acute and chronic lower abdominal pain in womenectopic pregnancy and maternal deathfirst trimester abortion; andsevere neonatal eye infections that may lead to blindnessFinancial ImplicationsSeparate
 from the growing severity of medical risks, gonococcal infections 
represent an enormous potential financial cost both for individuals and 
governments. Based on the 2013 global estimates of incident gonococcal 
infections, approximately 300 000 healthy lives would be lost yearly due
 to infections, with the burden of disease estimated to increase 
further. There is a real worry as we see both the number of people 
becoming infected and a rise in number of people with long-term 
complications associated with gonococcal infections. Spread of diseaseThe emergence of different forms of resistance in N. gonorrhoea
 is often followed by a rapid spread of the disease.  The effect of this
 is felt in all countries, but with disproportional effects in low- and 
middle-income countries, whose health systems maybe underdeveloped or 
lacking resources. It is important to remember that we are all at risk 
of epidemics produced by antimicrobial resistance."
1. Another sector in my country is already developing (or has already submitted) a proposal for readiness funds. Can the health sector still access readiness funds?,"Yes. Nationally Designated Authorities (NDAs) may have multiple readiness grants under implementation at the same time, as long as they collectively do not exceed the yearly funding cap of USD 1 million."
2. My country is already preparing a GCF project proposal. Are we still able to access readiness funds?,"Yes, you may access readiness while preparing a funding proposal, however, the readiness funds cannot be used to develop a full project proposal. If your country has not yet received the full allocation of available readiness funds the fact that you are pursuing the development of a full project proposal doesn’t mean that you cannot access readiness funds. Since the development and potential approval of a full proposal is a long process, accessing readiness funds may be a good way to increase health representation within the GCF portfolio."
3. What are multi-year readiness proposals and what type of activities are eligible?,"Multi-year readiness proposals can be submitted for readiness activities that will be implemented over multiple years, up to a maximum of 3 years and a maximum of USD 3 million (capped at USD 1 million/country/year). The main purpose of a multi-year proposal is to allow countries to be more programmatic in their approach to readiness. Countries and delivery partners should carefully read the conditions for submission in the guidebook for this type of readiness proposal."
4. Can countries submit a regional readiness proposal?,"Yes. Several countries can develop a regional-level readiness proposal.  Each country included in the proposal must contribute a part of their USD 1 million cap and all countries will benefit from the activities. If five countries are submitting a proposal, one of the five must submit the proposal to the GCF and all of the countries must submit a financial support letter indicating how much each country is contributing to this proposal. Not every country must contribute the same amount to the proposal. For example, if five countries develop a regional readiness proposal and each agrees to contribute USD 300k the total readiness proposal value will be USD 1.5 million. Another example is two countries contribute USD 400k and three countries contribute 100k, the total readiness proposal value will be USD 1.1 million."
5. Is it possible for a country to join a regional proposal and at the same time submit country-level readiness proposals?,"Yes. Countries can submit proposals for up to USD 1 million per year, and NDAs may have multiple readiness grants under implementation simultaneously. For example, if a country joins a regional proposal and agrees to contribute USD 300k, and they have no other readiness projects for that year, then the remaining USD 700k can be sought for other country-level readiness activities."
6. Who submits a regional readiness proposal?,"A regional Readiness is submitted by a ""Lead"" NDA, with support letters from the NDAs of all other participating countries."
7. How are regional GCF readiness projects coordinated?,"The regional-level coordination will depend upon the specific projects and country contexts. NDAs have national level coordination mechanisms which will need to be considered in planning regional level coordination.However, regional coordination for a readiness project where WHO is the delivery partner will usually be managed by the WHO Regional Office with WHO Headquarters providing high level coordination and advice."
What is the FGM cost calculator?,It is an interactive online tool developed by WHO to visualize current health care related costs of FGM. The tool allows users to see cost savings that can be expected by abandoning the practice in current and future generations in about 30 countries which have the highest prevalence of FGM.
What is WHO doing to address FGM?,"WHO plays a critical role in building the health sector response to FGM. The primary aim of this work is to support countries to prevent the practice of FGM while also ensuring that health care providers can provide the highest quality care possible for the millions of women and girls already affected. WHO: (1) develops evidence-based guidance and tools for the health sector to prevent FGM and manage its health complications; (2) supports countries to strengthen their health sector response to FGM; and (3) generates evidence on the epidemiology and costs of FGM, as well as evidence on effectiveness of interventions to prevent FGM and mitigate its consequences."
What types of costs are included in the tool?,"FGM increases the risk of multiple health complications, which have significant costs. To ensure the economic model was data driven and to maintain clear parameters of the cost analysis, the tool shares estimates of health-related costs attributable to FGM and the reduction in these costs that could potentially be achieved with abandonment of FGM.
There are many additional costs of FGM, not covered by this tool. Some of these are presently not quantifiable. Some of these have not been sufficiently researched which means there is a lack of evidence to include into an economic model."
Which countries are included in the tool?,"27 countries with a high prevalence of FGM are included in the tool.  These countries have existing population-based data on the prevalence of FGM. 
There are also estimates available on specific types of FGM for these countries. Countries included are: Benin, Burkina Faso, Central African Republic, Côte d'Ivoire, Cameroon, Chad, Djibouti, Egypt, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Ghana, Guinea, Gambia, Guinea-Bissau, Iraq, Kenya, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Sudan, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Togo, United Republic of Tanzania, Yemen. 
While population-based data for Liberia, Indonesia and Uganda exist, these countries were not included as they lacked data on types of FGM."
Why do costs not disappear when FGM is abandoned?,"Throughout the world, there are currently 200 million women and girls already affected by FGM. Some are still children and unfortunately many continue to suffer health consequences as a result of FGM. These health consequences, and their associated costs generally cannot be prevented.  
Countries must continue to ensure provision of the highest quality health care to women and girls affected by FGM. WHO has developed guidance and tools to help countries and health care providers to provide high quality health care."
Why does this tool focus on economic cost only?,"The burden of health costs can be a powerful incentive for countries to take action to ensure that FGM is reduced and abandoned.  The financial burden for health systems is linked to sustainable development and human rights. When women thrive, families and communities are also more likely to thrive.
Prevention of FGM helps girls and women to reach their full potential, for example, by participating fully in society through education and work. 
By preventing FGM, countries can reduce their expenditures for treatment and care, child protection and judicial services, which may enable them to invest more fully in development initiatives – which in turn can support the rights of girls, women and entire populations of a country."
Why is it important to estimate the financial cost of female genital mutilation (FGM)?,"The health complications caused by FGM put a heavy financial burden on health systems.  Preventing new cases of FGM will reduce cost to countries, communities and individual women and their families."
Why is zero tolerance of FGM so important?,"WHO promotes a zero tolerance stance to FGM. Any type of FGM can lead to severe health complications, both in the short and long-term. FGM is internationally recognized as a violation of the human rights of girls and women and must never be carried out."
What can be done to prevent antimicrobial resistance and spread of resistance in antibiotic resistant gonorrhea?,"To prevent the continued problem of multidrug-resistant N. gonorrhoeae infections two goals must be met.We must control, on a broadlevel, drug resistanceWe must control gonorrhea (gonococcal infections)Controlling gonococcal infections involves a range of actions: Effective
 prevention and control of gonococcal infections, using prevention 
messages and interventions and appropriate treatment regimensEffective drug regulations in place  Strengthened antimicrobial resistance surveillance; especially in countries with a high burden of gonococcal infectionsCapacity
 building  to establish regional networks of laboratories to perform 
gonococcal culture, with good quality control mechanismsSystematic
 monitoring of treatment failures by developing a standard case 
definition of treatment failure and protocols for monitoringResearch into newer molecular methods for monitoring and detecting antimicrobial resistanceIdentification of, and research into, alternative effective treatment regimens for gonococcal infections"
What new medications are available/ what new research needs to be done to stop resistant gonorrhea becoming a worse issue?,"Increasing resistance to the last-line 
treatment for gonorrhea, poses a big challenge because it limits the 
treatment choices available for gonorrhea infections. The development of
 resistance clearly outpaces the development of new antibiotics. There 
is an urgent need to develop new treatment options for gonorrhea.The Global Antibiotic Research and Development Partnership (GARDP), a joint initiative between the World Health Organisation (WHO) and Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative
 (DNDi), aims to facilitate the development, clinical evaluation and 
registration of new antimicrobials and therapeutic regimens for 
gonorrhea. This is being accompanied by a sound access strategy and 
stewardship framework, so that the newly developed antibiotics are not 
lost to resistance within a few years after their introduction.Gonococcal
 antimicrobial resistance will only be effectively mitigated when 
additionally the global gonorrhea burden is reduced. This is why sexual 
education is so important.Apart from 
prevention through safer sexual behavior, the development of a vaccine 
to prevent transmission is vital and an effective gonococcal vaccine is 
likely the only sustainable solution for effective control of gonorrhea."
Are there immediate and long-term health benefits of quitting for all smokers?,"Beneficial health changes that take place:Within 20 minutes, your heart rate and blood pressure drop.12 hours, the carbon monoxide level in your blood drops to normal.2-12 weeks, your circulation improves and your lung function increases.1-9 months, coughing and shortness of breath decrease.1 year, your risk of coronary heart disease is about half that of a smoker's.5 years, your stroke risk is reduced to that of a nonsmoker 5 to 15 years after quitting.10 years, your risk of lung cancer falls to about half that of a smoker and your risk of cancer of the mouth, throat, esophagus, bladder, cervix, and pancreas decreases.15 years, the risk of coronary heart disease is that of a nonsmoker's."
Can people of all ages who have already developed smoking-related health problems still benefit from quitting?,"Benefits in comparison with those who continued:At about 30: gain almost 10 years of life expectancy.At about 40: gain 9 years of life expectancy.At about 50: gain 6 years of life expectancy.At about 60: gain 3 years of life expectancy.After the onset of life-threatening disease: rapid benefit, people who quit smoking after having a heart attack reduce their chances of having another heart attack by 50%."
How does quitting smoking affect children who are exposed to second-hand smoke?,"Quitting smoking decreases the excess risk of many diseases related to second-hand smoke in children, such as respiratory diseases (e.g., asthma) and ear infections."
Are there any other benefits to quitting smoking?,"Quitting smoking reduces the chances of impotence, having difficulty getting pregnant, having premature births, babies with low birth weights and miscarriage.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------			Reference1.

How are COVID-19 and influenza viruses similar?,"Firstly, COVID-19 and influenza viruses have a similar disease presentation. That is, they both cause respiratory disease, which presents as a wide range of illness from asymptomatic or mild through to severe disease and death.  Secondly, both viruses are transmitted by contact, droplets and fomites. As a result, the same public health measures, such as hand hygiene and good respiratory etiquette (coughing into your elbow or into a tissue and immediately disposing of the tissue), are important actions all can take to prevent infection."
How are COVID-19 and influenza viruses different?,"The speed of transmission is an important point of difference between the two viruses. Influenza has a shorter median incubation period (the time from infection to appearance of symptoms) and a shorter serial interval (the time between successive cases) than COVID-19 virus. The serial interval for COVID-19 virus is estimated to be 5-6 days, while for influenza virus, the serial interval is 3 days. This means that influenza can spread faster than COVID-19.   Further, transmission in the first 3-5 days of illness, or potentially pre-symptomatic transmission –transmission of the virus before the appearance of symptoms – is a major driver of transmission for influenza. In contrast, while we are learning that there are people who can shed COVID-19 virus 24-48 hours prior to symptom onset, at present, this does not appear to be a major driver of transmission.   The reproductive number – the number of secondary infections generated from one infected individual – is understood to be between 2 and 2.5 for COVID-19 virus, higher than for influenza. However, estimates for both COVID-19 and influenza viruses are very context and time-specific, making direct comparisons more difficult.   Children are important drivers of influenza virus transmission in the community. For COVID-19 virus, initial data indicates that children are less affected than adults and that clinical attack rates in the 0-19 age group are low. Further preliminary data from household transmission studies in China suggest that children are infected from adults, rather than vice versa.  While the range of symptoms for the two viruses is similar, the fraction with severe disease appears to be different. For COVID-19, data to date suggest that 80% of infections are mild or asymptomatic, 15% are severe infection, requiring oxygen and 5% are critical infections, requiring ventilation. These fractions of severe and critical infection would be higher than what is observed for influenza infection. Those most at risk for severe influenza infection are children, pregnant women, elderly, those with underlying chronic medical conditions and those who are immunosuppressed. For COVID-19, our current understanding is that older age and underlying conditions increase the risk for severe infection.  Mortality for COVID-19 appears higher than for influenza, especially seasonal influenza. While the true mortality of COVID-19 will take some time to fully understand, the data we have so far indicate that the crude mortality ratio (the number of reported deaths divided by the reported cases) is between 3-4%, the infection mortality rate (the number of reported deaths divided by the number of infections) will be lower. For seasonal influenza, mortality is usually well below 0.1%. However, mortality is to a large extent determined by access to and quality of health care."
What medical interventions are available for COVID-19 and influenza viruses?,"While there are a number of therapeutics currently in clinical trials in China and more than 20 vaccines in development for COVID-19, there are currently no licensed vaccines or therapeutics for COVID-19.  In contrast, antivirals and vaccines available for influenza. While the influenza vaccine is not effective against COVID-19 virus, it is highly recommended to get vaccinated each year to prevent influenza infection."
8. How are funds distributed to multiple countries for regional readiness projects?,"GCF Readniess Funding is dispersed to the readiness Delivery Partner and not directly to participating countries.For regional readiness projects where WHO is the delivery partner WHO HQ will receive funds directly from the GCF. These funds can then be transferred to the WHO regional or country office depending on approved activities and implementation arrangement of the proposal.  Funds can only be transferred to an approved GCF delivery partner or to implementation partners contracted through established, transparent procurement processes."
What is 5G?,"5G, or fifth Generation, is the latest wireless mobile phone technology, first widely deployed in 2019. 5G is expected to increase performance and a wide range of new applications, including strengthening e-Health (telemedicine, remote surveillance, telesurgery)."
What are the main differences between 5G and previous technologies?,"5G represents an evolution in telecommunication standards. To enable increased performance, 5G will extend into higher frequencies around 3.5 GHz and up to a few tens of GHz.  The higher frequencies are new to mobile phone networks, but are commonly used in other applications, such as point-to-point radio links and body-scanners for security checks. At these higher frequencies, 5G networks will use a greater number of base stations and of connected objects. 5G will further employ beam-forming antennas to focus signals more efficiently towards the device in use, rather than having the signal spread in broad directions as in current base station antennas."
Will the standards be applicable to all children?,"The standards describe normal child growth from birth to 5 years under optimal environmental conditions and can be applied to all children everywhere, regardless of ethnicity, socioeconomic status and type of feeding."
What reference data should be used for children older than 5 years?,"Please see “WHO Reference 2007 for boys and girls, 5-19 years at  https://www.who.int/growthref/en/."
Why are new standards needed?,"Since the late 1970s, the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS)/WHO growth reference has been in use which describes how children grow in a particular region and time. This reference was based on data from several samples of children from a single
    country and suffers from a number of technical and biological drawbacks that make it inadequate to monitor the rapid and changing rate of early childhood growth.Under the leadership of WHO, the United Nations in 1993 undertook a comprehensive review of the uses and interpretation of child growth references. The review concluded that it was time to develop new standards that show how children should grow in all
    countries rather than merely describing how they grew at a particular time and place.Following this review, in 1994, the World Health Assembly (WHA) endorsed the development of a new set of tools to assess infant and young child growth. The Assembly stressed the need to move beyond past approaches and toward the more desirable goal of
    describing how all children should grow when their needs are met.In setting this ambitious goal, WHO and its principal partner, the United Nations University, in collaboration with a number of academic institutions worldwide, undertook the Multicentre Growth Reference Study (MGRS), a community-based, multi-country
    project to develop new growth standards for infants and young children.The study involved the recruitment of children who met a number of health criteria in 6 countries representing different regions of the world: Brazil, Ghana, India, Norway, Oman, and the United States. The 8,440 children included in the study were raised
    in environments that minimized constraints to growth such as poor diets and infection. In addition, their mothers followed health practices such as breastfeeding their children and not smoking during and after pregnancy."
How different are the new standards from the old growth charts?,"The new standards differ from any existing growth charts in a number of innovative ways. First, the MGRS was designed to provide data that describe “how children should grow,” by including in the study’s selection criteria specific health
    behaviours that are consistent with current health promotion recommendations (e.g., breastfeeding norms, standard pediatric care, non-smoking requirements). This new approach is fundamentally different from that taken by the traditional descriptive references. By adopting a prescriptive approach, the protocol’s design went beyond an update of how children in presumably healthy populations grow at a
    specific time and place and explicitly recognize the need for standards (i.e., devices that enable value judgments by incorporating norms or targets in their construction). Arguably, the current obesity epidemic in many developed countries would
    have been detectable earlier if a prescriptive international standard had been available 20 years ago.Another key characteristic of the new standard is that it makes breastfeeding the biological “norm” and establishes the breastfed infant as the normative growth model. The previous reference was based on the growth of artificially-fed children.The pooled sample from the 6 participating countries will allow the development of a truly international standard (in contrast to the previous international reference based on children from a single country) and reiterate the fact that child populations
    grow similarly across the world’s major regions when their needs for health and care are met.These standards also include new innovative growth indicators beyond height and weight that are particularly useful for monitoring the increasing epidemic of childhood obesity, such as the skinfold thickness. The study’s longitudinal nature will also allow the development of growth velocity standards. Health care providers will not have to wait until children cross an attained growth threshold to make the diagnosis of under-nutrition and overweight since
    velocity standards will enable the early identification of children in the process of becoming under- or over-nourished. Lastly, the development of accompanying windows of achievement for six key motor development milestones will provide a unique link between physical growth and motor development."
Overview,"Vaccination is one of the best ways to prevent diseases. In total, vaccines are estimated to save between 2 and 3 million lives every year.Together with governments, vaccines manufacturers, scientists and medical experts, WHO's vaccine safety programme is constantly helping monitor the safety of vaccines.  This helps ensure that vaccines are safe for you and your family."
How do we know that a vaccine is safe?,"The most commonly used vaccines we have today have been in use for decades, with millions of people receiving them safely every year. In addition, there are several new vaccines under development. If approved, these will help prevent more life-threatening diseases – such as COVID-19, Zika or Nipah viruses - or improve the effectiveness of existing vaccines. As with all medicines, every vaccine needs to go through extensive and rigorous testing before it can be introduced in a country. Once they are in use, they must be continuously monitored to make sure they are safe for the people who receive them."
Are there side effects from vaccines?,"Vaccines are very safe. As with all medicines, side effects can occur after getting a vaccine. However, these are usually very minor and of short duration, such as a sore arm or a mild fever. More serious side effects are possible, but extremely rare. A person is far more likely to be seriously harmed by a disease than by a vaccine. Vaccine-preventable diseases like measles, meningitis or polio can be deadly, or cause severe illness and disability. Possible complications of these diseases can include: Blindness; Deafness; Paralysis; Brain damage; Infertility; Cancer; Birth defects; Death."
How are vaccines tested?,"Once a promising vaccine is identified, it will firstly undergo scrupulous laboratory testing. This includes careful examination and testing of the vaccine and its ingredients. These tests evaluate the safety of the vaccine, and how well it prevents a disease.If positive results are achieved in the lab, a manufacturer can then apply to do clinical trials. These trials typically involve several thousand healthy volunteers participants on a voluntary basis, whose safety is ensured by national regulatory authorities, and last for many years. The trials are bound by strict regulations and take place across three main phases:During Phase I, small groups (approximately 20-50 people) receive the vaccine. This phase will assess the safety, side effects, appropriate dosage, method of administration and composition of the vaccine.If it is successful, it will proceed to Phase II. At this stage, the vaccine is usually given to several hundred people. This group will have the same characteristics (e.g. age, sex) as the people for whom the vaccine is intended to be given.In Phase III, the vaccine is usually given to thousands of people to help ensure it is safe and effective for broader use.The results of all these studies will be assessed when regulators decide whether to approve a vaccine. Studies may also take place after a vaccine is introduced. They enable scientists to monitor efficacy and safety among an even larger number of people, over a longer timeframe."
Who approves a vaccine?,"In countries where vaccines are manufactured, national or regional regulators oversee a vaccine’s development. This includes approving clinical trials, evaluating their results, and taking decisions on licensing. In deciding, regulators must refer to very strict international standards on acceptable ethical clinical practice.Once a vaccine has been developed, national regulators decide whether to introduce a vaccine in their countries. WHO provides information to support this process, through comprehensive evaluation of the available evidence, and its regularly updated position papers on vaccines."
How does safe water impact global health?,"Safe water supplies, hygienic sanitation and good water management are fundamental to global health. Almost one tenth of the global disease burden could be prevented by:

increasing access to safe drinking water;
improving sanitation and hygiene; and
improving water management to reduce risks of water-borne infectious diseases, and accidental drowning during recreation.

Annually, safer water could prevent:

1.4 million child deaths from diarrhoea;
500 000 deaths from malaria;
860 000 child deaths from malnutrition; and
280 000 deaths from drowning.

In addition, 5 million people can be protected from being seriously incapacitated from lymphatic filariasis and another 5 million from trachoma.
Recommended measures
Efforts to improve water, sanitation and hygiene interact with each other to boost overall health. Access to sanitation, such as simple latrines in communities, prevents drinking water contamination from human waste and reduces infections. High-tech public health measures are not necessarily the best: frequent hand-washing with soap and safe storage of drinking water are high-impact practices.
Environmental management effectively lowers the rates of malaria and other diseases spread by insects and prevents death. These measures include eliminating habitats - such as standing water - for breeding, and screening doors and windows for protection from mosquitoes.
Economic benefits
Investment to improve drinking water, sanitation, hygiene and water resource management systems makes strong economic sense: every dollar invested leads to up to eight dollars in benefits. US$ 84 billion a year could be regained from the yearly investment of US$ 11.3 billion needed to meet the water and sanitation targets under the Millennium Development Goals.
In addition to the value of saved human lives, other benefits include higher economic productivity, more education, and health-care savings."
Exposure levels,"Currently, exposure from 5G infrastructures at around 3.5 GHz is similar to that from existing mobile phone base stations. With the use of multiple beams from 5G antennas, exposure could be more variable as a function of location of the users and their usage. Given that the 5G technology is currently at an early stage of deployment, the extent of any change in exposure to radiofrequency fields is still under investigation."
What are the potential health risks from 5G?,"To date, and after much research performed, no adverse health effect has been causally linked with exposure to wireless technologies. Health-related conclusions are drawn from studies performed across the entire radio spectrum but, so far, only a few studies have been carried out at the frequencies to be used by 5G.Tissue heating is the main mechanism of interaction between radiofrequency fields and the human body. Radiofrequency exposure levels from current technologies result in negligible temperature rise in the human body. As the frequency increases, there is less penetration into the body tissues and absorption of the energy becomes more confined to the surface of the body (skin and eye). Provided that the overall exposure remains below international guidelines, no consequences for public health are anticipated."
What are the international exposure guidelines?,"Two international bodies produce exposure guidelines on electromagnetic fields. Many countries currently adhere to the guidelines recommended by:The International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection and,The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, through the International Committee on Electromagnetic SafetyThese guidelines are not technology-specific. They cover radiofrequencies up to 300 GHz, including the frequencies under discussion for 5G."
What is WHO doing?,"WHO is conducting a health risk assessment from exposure to radiofrequencies, covering the entire radiofrequency range, including 5G, to be published by 2022.WHO will review scientific evidence related to potential health risks from 5G exposure as the new technology is deployed, and as more public health-related data become available.WHO established the International Electromagnetic Fields (EMF) Project in 1996. The project investigates the health impact of exposure to electric and magnetic fields in the frequency range 0-300 GHz and advises national authorities on EMF radiation protection.WHO advocates for further research into the possible long-term health impacts of all aspects of mobile-telecommunications. The Organization identifies and promotes related research priorities. It also develops public information materials and promotes dialogue among scientists, governments, and the public to increase understanding around health and mobile communications. Relevant linksWHO Radiation health topicWHO EMF websiteNational regulations on exposure to EMFWHO Fact sheetsOn mobile phones On base stations"
Are pregnant women at higher risk from COVID-19?,"Research is currently underway to understand the impacts of COVID 19 infection on pregnant women. Data are limited, but at present there is no evidence that they are at higher risk of severe illness than the general population. However, due to changes in their bodies and immune systems, we know that pregnant women can be badly affected by some respiratory infections. It is therefore important that they take precautions to protect themselves against COVID-19, and report possible symptoms (including fever, cough or difficulty breathing) to their healthcare provider.WHO will continue to review and update its information and advice as more evidence becomes available."
I’m pregnant. How can I protect myself against COVID-19?,"Pregnant women should take the same precautions to avoid COVID-19 infection as other people. You can help protect yourself by:Washing your hands frequently with an alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water.Keeping space between yourselves and others and avoiding crowded spaces.Avoiding touching your eyes, nose and mouth.Practicing respiratory hygiene. This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately.If you have fever, cough or difficulty breathing, seek medical care early. Call before going to a health facility, and follow the directions of your local health authority. Pregnant women and women who have recently delivered – including those affected by COVID-19 - should attend their routine care appointments."
Should pregnant women be tested for COVID-19?,"Testing protocols and eligibility vary depending on where you live. However, WHO recommendations are that pregnant women with symptoms of COVID-19 should be prioritized for testing. If they have COVID-19, they may need specialized care."
Can COVID-19 be passed from a woman to her unborn or newborn baby?,"We still do not know if a pregnant woman with COVID-19 can pass the virus to her foetus or baby during pregnancy or delivery. To date, the virus has not been found in samples of amniotic fluid or breastmilk."
What care should be available during pregnancy and childbirth?,"All pregnant women, including those with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infections, have the right to high quality care before, during and after childbirth. This includes antenatal, newborn, postnatal, intrapartum and mental health care.A safe and positive childbirth experience includes:Being treated with respect and dignity;Having a companion of choice present during delivery;Clear communication by maternity staff;Appropriate pain relief strategies:Mobility in labour where possible, and birth position of choice.If COVID-19 is suspected or confirmed, health workers should take all appropriate precautions to reduce risks of infection to themselves and others, including hand hygiene, and appropriate use of protective clothing like gloves, gown and medical mask."
Do these new standards change current estimates of overweight and undernutrition in children?,"Yes, estimates are going to change because of differences in the pattern of growth between the new standards and the old reference, especially during infancy. The magnitude of the change in the estimates however will vary by age, sex, growth indicator,
    and the underlying nutritional status in the population being evaluated.A notable effect is that stunting (low height for age) will be greater throughout childhood when assessed using the new WHO standards compared to the previous international reference. There will be a substantial increase in underweight rates during the first half of infancy (i.e., 0-6 months) and a decrease thereafter. For wasting (low weight for length/height), the main difference between the new standards and the old reference is during infancy (i.e., up to about 70 cm length) when wasting rates will be substantially higher using the new WHO standards. With respect
    to overweight, use of the new WHO standards will result in a greater prevalence that will vary by age, sex and nutritional status of the index population."
What needs to be done/addressed/changed/improved so that all children grow well according to these standards?,"Breastfeeding should be supported, protected, and promoted. For the first 6 months, mothers need to be informed and empowered to practice exclusive breastfeeding. Children should be provided safe, wholesome, and nutritionally appropriate foods during the period of complementary feeding and after the second year when breastfeeding has ceased. Sound nutritional practices are important throughout childhood.      Appropriate national guidelines should be developed to aid caregivers in choosing nutritious local foods incorrect combinations and amounts to feed their children in order to maintain optimal growth in later childhood      (the aim being to avoid both nutritional deficiencies and excesses).Vaccinations and good health care should be available and accessible to all infants and young children. Families and their communities should do all they can to ensure that mothers have a good pregnancy.Nationally, full implementation of the objectives of the Global Strategy for Infant and Young Child Feeding (2002) would go a long way in creating supportive environments for mothers to breastfeed their children. The new standard can help stimulate change that facilitates these improvements. Therefore, the very first step should be implementing the new standard in every country and ensuring that every child has his/her own chart against which his/her growth is assessed followed by an appropriate follow-up."
Which cut-offs should we use for defining obesity risk in children?,"Please seeM. de Onis, T Lobstein. Defining obesity risk status in the general childhood population: Which cut-offs should we use? International Journal of Pediatric Obesity 2010;5:458-60."
How big is the problem of SF medical products?,"SF medical products are by their very nature difficult to detect. They are often designed to appear identical to the genuine product and may not cause an obvious adverse reaction, however they will fail to properly treat the disease or condition for which they were intended. There are many estimates of the scope and scale of the market in SF medical products but little validated evidence to underpin those estimates. WHO have withdrawn all of their previous estimations of the scale of the problem and in 2013 launched a global surveillance and monitoring system to encourage Member States to report SF incidents in a structured and systematic format, to assist in arriving at a more accurate and validated assessment of the scope, scale and harm caused by this issue. Medical products have so far been reported representing all main therapeutic categories and representing both innovator and generic medicines.In November 2017, WHO launched two important publications;WHO Global surveillance and monitoring system for substandard and falsified medical products, which highlights the causes, consequences and solutions.Study on the public health and socioeconomic impact of substandard and falsified medical products, which examines estimates of the prevalence and cost of the issue;Both publications provide more information on the scope, scale and harm of substandard and falsified medical products."
Which medical products are most affected?,"Reports received by WHO from Member States suggest that all therapeutic categories are affected by SF medical products. Anti-Infectives, Anti-Malarials and Genito urinary/Sex Hormones are particularly badly affected. Expensive cardio vascular and oncology products are targeted as well as low priced pain suppressants. Generic and Innovator medical products are both vulnerable to falsification as are the most expensive to the cheapest products. Those engaged in the manufacture, distribution and supply of SF medical products have shown they respond quickly to demand, thoroughly understanding the market and are fast to exploit opportunities."
What do SF medical Products Contain?,"SF medical products that have been subjected to laboratory analysis may contain no active ingredient, the wrong active ingredient or the wrong amount of the correct active ingredient.They are also found to commonly contain corn starch, potato starch or chalk.Some SF medical products have been toxic in nature with either fatal levels of the wrong active ingredient or other toxic chemicals.SF medical products are often produced in very poor and unhygienic conditions by unqualified personnel, the products will contain unknown impurities and are sometimes contaminated with bacteria."
Where do SF medical products come from?,"SF medical products are manufactured in many different countries and in all WHO regions. Member States and the media frequently report successful operations against manufacturers of SF medical products. Some reports refer to large scale manufacturing and others to small back street operations. With the availability of tableting machines, ovens, specialist equipment, ingredients and packaging materials, clandestine manufacturing facilities are quick and easy to assemble and have been discovered in all regions."
Which countries are affected the most?,"No countries remain untouched by this issue from North America and Europe through to Sub Saharan Africa, South East Asia, and Latin America. What was once considered a problem suffered by developing and low income countries has now become an issue for all. With the exponential increase in internet connectivity those engaged in the manufacture, distribution and supply of SF medical products have gained access to a global market place. This extends both to consumers and business to business forums. A culture of self-diagnosis and self-prescribing has led to the emergence of thousands of unregulated websites providing unsupervised access to SF medical products. However it is low and middle income countries and those in areas of conflict, or civil unrest, with very weak or non-existent health systems that bear the greatest burden of SF medical products."
How is vaccine safety monitored?,"As with all medicines, the safety of a vaccine must be continuously monitored, even after trials and vaccine introduction. This monitoring considers reports from several sources. Nationally, these include the people who get vaccines, parents or caregivers, and health workers. These reports are then submitted to national health authorities.At a regional and global level, WHO and UNICEF support countries in collecting and monitoring this information, and ensuring countries have the most up to date evidence on available vaccines."
What happens if a problem is suspected with a vaccine?,"If a potential problem is reported following vaccination, a thorough investigation will take place. Investigations involve a thorough examination of the case in question, including medical assessment. If necessary, detailed studies are conducted.During these investigations, it is extremely rare that health problems are found to be caused by the vaccine itself. Health events are most often found to be coincidental, i.e. entirely unrelated to vaccination. Sometimes, they are related to how the vaccine has been stored, transported or administered (for instance, where errors are made in preparing the vaccine). Such errors can be prevented by training health workers, and strengthening vaccination programmes.In the rare cases where a genuine adverse reaction is suspected, the vaccine may be suspended from use. Further investigations will take place to determine what exactly caused the event, and corrective measures put in place."
How does WHO help ensure vaccine safety?,"WHO works to make sure that everyone, everywhere is protected by safe and effective vaccines. To do this, we help countries set up rigorous safety systems for vaccines – alongside other medicines - and work to develop the strictest standards for their regulation. Together with external scientists, WHO experts are continuously monitoring and updating the safety profile of more than 20 vaccines. With external partners, it also helps countries investigate and communicate if potential issues of concern arise.Events that are reported to WHO are evaluated by an independent group of experts (the Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety, or GACVS). On behalf of this committee, WHO issues regular statements on vaccine safety. For more information on how vaccines work, see our Q&A on vaccines."
Do pregnant women with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 need to give birth by caesarean section?,No. WHO advice is that caesarean sections should only be performed when medically justified. The mode of birth should be individualized and based on a woman’s preferences alongside obstetric indications.
Can women with COVID-19 breastfeed?,"Yes. Women with COVID-19 can breastfeed if they wish to do so. They should:Practice respiratory hygiene during feeding, wearing a mask where available; Wash hands before and after touching the baby;Routinely clean and disinfect surfaces they have touched."
Can I touch and hold my newborn baby if I have COVID-19?,"Yes. Close contact and early, exclusive breastfeeding helps a baby to thrive. You should be supported toBreastfeed safely, with good respiratory hygiene; Hold your      newborn skin-to-skin, and Share a room      with your babyYou should wash your hands before and after touching your baby, and keep all surfaces clean."
I have COVID-19 and am too unwell to breastfeed my baby directly. What can I do?,"If you are too unwell to breastfeed your baby due to COVID-19 or other complications, you should be supported to safely provide your baby with breastmilk in a way possible, available, and acceptable to you. This could include:Expressing milk;Relactation;Donor human milk."
What is the harm caused by SF medical products?,"Assessing the harm caused by SF medical products is complex and difficult. Most cases involve a medical product that fails to work properly. Often the product will not cause a toxic reaction, but will fail to treat the condition for which it was intended, with potentially devastating consequences. A patient failing to respond to their anti-malarial or who suffers an unwanted pregnancy will rarely consider the cause of the problem to be their medicine. Effective vigilance and awareness amongst healthcare professionals, efficient reporting mechanisms for patients as well as strong post market surveillance of medical products in circulation are needed in order to quickly identify problems.Some SF medical products do cause serious adverse reactions and sometimes fatalities. When these incidents occur in a close geographic area over a short time period they are more easily identified and reported.Cases are reported to WHO arising from an unexpected and disproportionate rise in mortality at healthcare facilities.The WHO Global Surveillance and Monitoring System and other WHO vigilance systems pick up this data.In November 2017, two important WHO publications will be launched:WHO Global surveillance and monitoring system for substandard and falsified medical products, which highlights the causes, consequences and solutions.Study on the public health and socioeconomic impact of substandard and falsified medical products, which examines estimates of the prevalence and cost of the issue;Both publications will provide more information on the scope, scale and harm of substandard and falsified medical products."
How do SF medical products enter the supply chain?,"Most commonly, SF medical products enter the legal supply chain at distribution level through hospitals, clinics, pharmacies and wholesalers, who have obtained medical products from unknown sources and intermediaries without checking their credentials or conducting any due diligence. Supply chains can be long and complex. The more extended the supply chain, the more vulnerable they are to weak links and the insertion of SF medical products.SF medical products are frequently found in unlicensed and illegal outlets, this includes street markets, hawkers and illegal internet pharmacies. However, they are also reported from legal and regulated venues such as hospitals, clinics, pharmacies and drug stores in all regions. These are precisely the locations where patients should have the highest degree of confidence that the medical products they receive are safe, good quality and effective."
Are deterrents strong enough?,"Many countries have started to strengthen their legislation in respect of SF medical products and specifically intentionally falsified medical products. Traditionally sanctions have been weak and remain so in many countries. Strong legislation alone is not enough, criminal justice systems need to be willing to handle these types of cases in an effective and efficient manner. National medicines regulatory authorities and law enforcement agencies need to collaborate and awareness raising is required amongst the prosecutors and the judiciary. Many investigations concerning SF medical products are international in nature. This makes gathering evidence more complex. Countries need to have in place mutual legal assistance treaties to permit gathering of evidence from other jurisdictions to support prosecutions. Member States with legal powers to restrain and confiscate assets and recover the proceeds of criminal activity have met with some success. Especially if laws allow for a proportion of the seized assets to be reinvested in purchasing detection devices and laboratory equipment or finance awareness campaigns and training events.In broad terms the manufacture, distribution and supply of SF medical products is a low risk/high profit activity with disproportionately low sanctions, and as such has attracted the attention of organised criminal activity."
Is organised crime involved in SF medical products?,"Some of those involved in the manufacture, distribution and supply of spurious, falsified and counterfeit medical products have access to sophisticated networks of off shore companies to facilitate the movement of the products, off shore bank accounts to launder the proceeds and flexible freight networks to ship the products to their eventual destinations. They operate a highly organised, professional, lucrative and criminal business. Others involved are relatively disorganised with small illegal manufacturing sites and local distribution.In broad terms the manufacture, distribution and supply of SF medical products is a low risk/high return activity with disproportionately low sanctions, and as such has attracted the attention of organised criminal activity."
Is there a need for International Law?,"The manufacture, distribution and supply of SF medical products is a Global issue. With the globalization of the pharmaceutical sector and wide access to internet and communications technologies no single country or organization can hope to effectively tackle the problem in isolation.Some aspects of the issue require a regulatory response, others a criminal law response, but most require International collaboration. Many countries rely on existing Mutual legal assistance treaties, extradition treaties and co-operative arrangements, others do not have those facilities available.Having an effective regulatory and criminal legal framework in place at the National level, with dissuasive sanctions, is the first step towards preventing the proliferation of SF medical products. However in addition to legislation an efficient investigative process and transparent criminal justice system is required to ensure the proportionate application of the law.The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) have carried out some work on developing a legislative framework in relation to this topic focusing on fraudulent medicine.The Council of Europe have drafted the Medicrime convention which constitutes a binding International Instrument in the field of criminal law on the counterfeiting of medical products and similar crimes involving threats to public health."
How will the global response to the pandemic H1N1 be reviewed?,"The assessment of the global response to the pandemic H1N1 will be conducted by the International Health Regulations Review Committee, a committee of experts with a broad mix of scientific expertise and practical experience in public health. The members are some of the leading experts in the world in their respective fields.The International Health Regulations (IHR) is an international legal agreement that is binding on 194 States Parties across the globe, including all of the Member States of WHO. The basic purpose of the IHR is to help the international community prevent and respond to acute public health risks that have the potential to cross borders and threaten people worldwide.In January 2010, the WHO Executive Board requested a proposal from the Director-General on how to assess the international response to the pandemic influenza, and then approved her suggestion to convene the IHR Review Committee to review both the pandemic response and the functioning of the IHR.The pandemic H1N1 is the first public health emergency of international concern to occur since the revised IHR came into force. The IHR played a central role in the global response to the pandemic and so review of the IHR and review of the global handling of the pandemic influenza are closely related.The IHR facilitate coordinated international action by requiring countries to report certain disease outbreaks and public health events to WHO so that global reporting of important public health events is timely and open.The IHR were first implemented (i.e., ""entered into force"") worldwide in 2007 and the Health Assembly determined that a first review of its functioning is to take place by the 63rd World Health Assembly in May 2010.ObjectivesThe review has three key objectives:Assess the functioning of the International Health Regulations (2005);Assess the ongoing global response to the pandemic H1N1 (including the role of WHO); andIdentify lessons learned important for strengthening preparedness and response for future pandemics and public health emergencies.The committeeThe IHR Review Committee is made up of approximately 29 members who have been selected from the roster of experts under the IHR structure or other WHO expert committees. The committee members represent a broad mix of expertise, practical experience and backgrounds, and includes experts from developed and developing countries.The members are some of the leading experts in the world in their respective fields. They are not WHO staff, nor do they receive funding from WHO for their contributions to the review process. Names of the committee members were made public prior to the first meeting:List of members of the review committeeAt the first meeting, Professor Harvey V. Fineberg was elected as chair; Professor Babatunde Osotimehin was elected as vice chair.The IHR Review Committee is considered a WHO expert committee and so its operations and structure follows regulations for WHO expert advisory panels and committees, and provisions of the IHR.ProceedingsThe committee will determine its methods and schedule of work.The first meeting is scheduled for 12-14 April 2010 at WHO headquarters in Geneva.Observers invited to the first meeting include representatives of all States Parties to the IHR (194 countries), United Nations organizations and relevant intergovernmental organizations, and nongovernmental organizations in official relations with WHO.The committee will advise the Director-General of its views and findings. Based on the committee's advice, the Director-General will provide an interim report to the World Health Assembly (WHA) in May 2010, and an expected second, final report to the WHA in May 2011.Participation by countries (IHR States Parties)Countries will have the opportunity to make brief statements to the committee at first meeting, and may also submit comments to the Review Committee on key issues, concerns and lessons learned related to the pandemic response and functioning of the IHR.More about the IHRIn the globalized world, diseases can rapidly spread far and wide via international travel and trade. A health crisis in one country can impact livelihoods and economies in many parts of the world. Emerging infections such as an influenza pandemic are an important cause of such events. However, other public health emergencies such as chemical spills, leaks and dumping, or nuclear melt-downs may similarly have global effects.The IHR are not specific for any one disease or group of diseases but generally aim to limit interference with international traffic and trade while ensuring public health through the prevention of disease spread. The IHR define the rights and obligations of countries to report public health events, and establish a number of procedures that WHO must follow in its work to uphold global public health security. The IHR also require countries to strengthen their existing capacities for public health surveillance and response.(updated from 1 April 2010 version)"
Why is the population ageing?,"The ageing of the world's populations is the result of the 
continued decline in fertility rates and increased life expectancy. This
 demographic change has resulted in increasing numbers and proportions 
of people who are over 60. As a result, the first time in history when 
there will be more older people than younger people is rapidly 
approaching."
What issues related to ageing are WHO working on?,"WHO is working on three areas with a direct impact on ageing:prevention of chronic disease;access to age-friendly primary health care;
creation of age-friendly environments.
WHO has developed guidelines that help countries to understand
 the types of programmes they can put in place to improve healthcare 
settings and cities so they are better suited to the needs of older 
people. WHO supports networks where countries can share technical 
information, discuss strategies and policies that have worked in their 
country to improve the lives of older people."
What is WHO doing to increase our understanding of health and ageing?,"To increase our understanding of the health implications of 
ageing, particularly in less developed countries, WHO is undertaking the
 Study on global ageing and adult health (SAGE). This 
longitudinal follow-up of approximately 50 000 older adults is being 
carried out in China, Ghana, India, Mexico, Russian Federation and South
 Africa.  The study links a related international network of health and 
demographic surveillance: the Demographic evaluation of populations and their health
 (INDEPTH). Comparisons with similar studies in high income countries 
will provide opportunities to understand similarities and differences in
 the health and well being of older adults globally."
What roles do older people take on in society?,"Older persons work in a paid or unpaid capacity, care for family 
members and friends, and carry out after-retirement work in 
organizations and associations. They pass their experiences onto younger
 generations and by doing so, they help them strengthen their 
capacities. A high percentage of older people care for their 
grandchildren or other relatives and friends regularly and thus, in case
 of grandchildren, are supporting their children. In Africa, for 
example, family support of grandparents plays a particularly important 
role supporting children, as the parent's generation has been strongly 
impacted by the effects of HIV/AIDS.Related linkAgeing and life course"
About 20−40% of global health spending is wasted. How can countries be more efficient?,"The world health report 2010 – Health systems financing: the path to universal coverage focuses on 10 opportunities to improve efficiencies. One area is hospitals. Another is medicines. In all cases, the
 report stresses  governments be tough on accountability  and on getting
 the best deal. This means taking steps like those seen recently in 
Kenya and the United Republic of Tanzania to improve quality standards 
for malaria drugs. Getting the best deal means negotiating prices. In some 
countries, medicines cost up to 67 times the international average 
price. France saved the equivalent of almost US$ 2 billion in 2008 by 
adopting a strategy of using generic drugs rather than brand name ones 
wherever possible.There are often several ways to prevent or treat a medical 
condition - and costs vary widely. In many cases, it is possible to move
 to less costly more effective interventions."
What are the components of a model health financing system?,"A country is on the right track if the government is:demonstrating the political will to develop the health financing 
system, to move closer to, or maintain universal coverage and is 
engaging all stakeholders including the population in the process;
	allocating sufficient funds to health - this varies depending on 
the context. The average in Africa is just over 10%.  The average 
proportion of total government spending devoted to health in Europe is 
almost 13%;researching new sources of revenue, such as different forms of 
indirect taxation like sales taxes, so called ""sin"" taxes on tobacco and
 alcohol, and taxes on currency transactions;
setting up (or has set up) a system so that people pay for health
 care before they fall sick and draw on the funds when they are sick 
(through health insurance and/or taxation);focusing on getting the best value out of every dollar it spends on health;ensuring that vulnerable groups do not miss out on needed services."
What should donors do?,"Donors need to keep their international promises. Donor 
assistance has increased substantially since 2000. But it is still a 
long way off the target that many developed countries set themselves of 
0.7% of GDP. Official development assistance from governments can be 
supplemented by a variety of innovative financing mechanisms - like the 
airline tax pioneered by France and the Global Fund's ProductRED 
campaign.  When funds are channeled to countries, this should be done in 
ways that explicitly help recipient countries establish their own 
financing mechanisms and institutions. This means a greater focus on 
supporting countries' own plans and it means not establishing manifold 
channels for holding, using and reporting funds in countries that 
compete with the mechanisms that already exist."
What is new in health financing in the report?,"For the first time, The world health report 2010 
suggests that all countries can further develop their health financing 
systems.  If every country implemented just one of the report's 
recommendations, millions of lives would be saved. The report also shows for the first time the amount of money 
that low and middle income countries could raise themselves through a 
variety of options.  For example, simply giving more priority to health 
in government budget allocations could double government health spending
 in low income countries. The report also quantifies the losses that result from just 10
 common causes of inefficiency, offering enormous potential for 
obtaining more health for the money."
The disease - What is meningococcal disease?,"Meningitis is an infection of the meninges, the thin lining that surrounds the brain and the spinal cord. It is usually caused by a virus or bacterium (meningococcus). It is transmitted through droplets of respiratory or throat secretions. Bacterial meningitis, such as meningococcal disease, can be very serious because it evolves rapidly and can kill in a few hours. Even with appropriate treatment, around10% of patients die, and up to 20% of survivors have serious permanent health problems as a result of the disease (deafness, epilepsy, cerebral palsy or mental retardation)."
What is the extent of meningococcal disease in Africa?,"Sub-Saharan Africa has been experiencing explosive and repeated meningococcal epidemics for more than a hundred years. Group A meningococcus is the main cause of meningitis epidemics and accounts for an estimated 80% to 85% of all cases. These deadly epidemics occur at intervals of 7–14 years in the 25 countries of the ""meningitis belt,"" a strip of land that extends from Senegal in the west to Ethiopia in the east. Around 450 million people in this area are at risk of disease.More than one million cases of meningitis have been reported in Africa since 1988. In 1996-1997, the largest epidemic wave ever recorded swept across Africa, causing more than 250 000 cases and 25 000 deaths."
The vaccine - What is the expected public health impact of this new vaccine?,"If introduced in all 25 countries of the African meningitis belt, this vaccine is expected to eliminate the primary cause of epidemic meningitis, meningococcal A, from the entire region, with an estimated 150 000 young lives saved by 2015."
What advantages does MenAfriVac have over existing polysaccharide meningococcal vaccines currently used to combat epidemics in Africa?,"Contrary to polysaccharide vaccines that are used currently to control epidemics after they have begun, the new conjugate vaccine will be offered to prevent epidemics. Key advantages of the new vaccine over existing polysaccharide vaccines are:it induces a higher and more sustainable immune response against the most prominent strain in the most affected age groups, from 1-29 years;it is expected to confer long-term protection not only for those who receive the vaccine, but on family members and others who would otherwise have been exposed to meningitis, given reduced transmission:it will be available at a lower price than other meningococcal vaccines, and significantly lower than other cutting-edge vaccines recently introduced in Africa; andit is expected to be particularly effective in protecting children under two years of age, who do not respond to conventional polysaccharide vaccines."
What triggers an asthma attack?,"Asthma is a chronic breathing disorder characterized by 
recurrent attacks of breathlessness and wheezing. Some causes and 
triggers are common to all people with asthma, and some are more 
individual. Although the fundamental causes of asthma are not completely
 understood, the strongest risk factors for developing asthma are 
inhaled asthma triggers. These include:


indoor allergens (for example house dust mites in bedding, carpets and stuffed furniture, pollution and pet dander); outdoor allergens (such as pollens and moulds);tobacco smoke; andchemical irritants in the workplace. Other triggers can include cold air, extreme emotional arousal
 such as anger or fear, and physical exercise. In some people, asthma 
can even be triggered by certain medications, such as aspirin and other 
non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs, and beta-blockers (which are used 
to treat high blood pressure, heart conditions and migraine). 
Urbanization has also been associated with an increase in asthma, 
however the exact nature of this relationship is unclear.According to WHO estimates, 235 million people suffer from 
asthma globally. Although asthma cannot be cured, appropriate management
 can control the disorder and enable people to enjoy good quality of 
life.  In addition, some children with milder forms of asthma outgrow 
their symptoms with age."
What is the recommended food for children in their very early years?,"Breast milk is the best food for the healthy growth and development of infants. Infants should be exclusively breastfed for the first six months of life to achieve optimal growth, development and health. After six months, they should be fed adequate and safe complementary foods while continuing breastfeeding for up to two years or beyond.Complementary foods should be rich in nutrients and given in adequate amounts. At six months, caregivers should introduce foods in small amounts and gradually increase the quantity as the child gets older. Young children should receive a variety of foods including meat, poultry, fish or eggs as often as possible. Infants can eat pureed, mashed and semi-solid foods beginning at 6 months, from 8 months, most infants can eat 'finger' foods, and from 12 months, most children can eat the same types of foods as consumed by the rest of the family. The consistency of foods should be appropriate for the child's age. Complementary foods should be given 2–3 times a day between 6–8 months, increasing to 3–4 times a day between 9–11 months. Between 12–23 months of age, 3–4 meals should be given. Also, depending on the child's appetite, 1–2 nutritious snacks can be offered between meals.In addition to providing an adequate variety, amount and frequency of foods, it is important that caregivers practice responsive feeding. That is, they should feed infants directly and assist older children when they feed themselves; feed slowly and patiently and encourage children to eat, but not force them; and when children refuse to eat, experiment with different combinations of foods. Feeding times are periods of learning and love - they are a time for caregivers to talk to the child, making eye to eye contact.These recommendations are made in the Global Strategy for Infant and Young Child Feeding, which was jointly developed by WHO and UNICEF in 2003.The strategy is a guide for countries to develop policies and implement activities addressing feeding practices and the nutritional status, growth and health of infants and children. It is based both on the evidence that nutrition plays a crucial role in the early months and years of life, and on the importance of appropriate feeding practices in achieving optimal health.Lack of appropriate feeding in early childhood is a major risk factor for ill-health throughout the course of life. The life-long impact may include poor school performance, reduced productivity, impaired intellectual and social development, or chronic diseases."
Up to what age can a baby stay well nourished by just being breastfed?,"Infants should be exclusively breastfed – i.e. receive only breast milk – for the first six months of life to achieve optimal growth, development and health. ""Exclusive breastfeeding"" is defined as giving no other food or drink – not even water – except breast milk. It does, however, allow the infant to receive oral rehydration salts (ORS), drops and syrups (vitamins, minerals and medicines). Breast milk is the ideal food for the healthy growth and development of infants; breastfeeding is also an integral part of the reproductive process with important implications for the health of mothers.WHO recommends that infants start receiving complementary foods at six months (180 days) of age in addition to breast milk. Foods should be adequate, meaning that they provide sufficient energy, protein and micronutrients to meet a growing child's nutritional needs. Foods should be prepared and given in a safe manner to minimize the risk of contamination. Feeding young infants requires active care and stimulation to encourage the child to eat.The transition from exclusive breastfeeding to full use of family foods is a very vulnerable period. It is the time when many infants become malnourished, contributing significantly to the high prevalence of malnutrition in children under five years of age worldwide. It is essential therefore that infants receive appropriate, adequate and safe complementary foods to ensure the right transition from the breastfeeding period to the full use of family foods.Amounts of foods to offerAgeTextureFrequencyAmount at each meala6-8 monthsStart with thick porridge, well mashed foodsContinue with mashed family foods2–3 meals per day, plus frequent breastfeedsDepending on the child's appetite, 1–2 snacks may be offeredStart with 2–3 tablespoonfuls per feed, increasing gradually to ½ of a 250 ml cup9–11 monthsFinely chopped or mashed foods, and foods that baby can pick up3–4 meals per day, plus breastfeedsDepending on the child's appetite, 1–2 snacks may be offered½ of a 250 ml cup/bowl12–23 monthsFamily foods, chopped or mashed if necessary3–4 meals per day, plus breastfeedsDepending on the child's appetite, 1–2 snacks may be offered¾ to full 250 ml cup/bowla Note: If baby is not breastfed, give in addition: 1-2 cups of milk per day, and 1-2 extra meals per day."

Will this vaccine protect against all types of meningococcal disease?,"No, MenAfriVac will only protect again disease caused by the group A meningococcus—the main cause of meningitis epidemics in Africa, accounting for about 80 to 85 percent of all cases. Meningitis cases caused by other groups, such as W135, X and C, also occur. Vaccines for other groups are either not yet available (X) or far too expensive for African countries (C, W, or Y in various combinations). However, it is hoped that a combination of ongoing research and development efforts and tiered pricing will contribute to making these vaccines available to developing countries in the future."
How was the vaccine developed?,"The new vaccine was developed through the Meningitis Vaccine Project (MVP), a product development partnership between WHO and PATH, an international non-profit organization. The project included transfer of technology for manufacture of the vaccine from CBER/FDA to the Serum Institute of India Ltd. The project was set up in 2001 with core funding from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. The overall mission of the MVP is to eliminate meningitis as a public health problem in sub-Saharan Africa through the development, testing, introduction, and widespread use of conjugate meningococcal vaccines.Clinical trials, beginning in 2005, have been carried out in the Gambia, Ghana, India, Mali and Senegal and have shown the vaccine to be safe and highly immunogenic."
How much will the vaccine cost?,"The vaccine will be sold at less than 50US¢ per dose, a price low enough to promote widespread uptake throughout the affected region."
What is the timeline for vaccination campaigns across the meningitis belt?,"Country-wide vaccination in Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger is scheduled to start in December. The campaign in Burkina Faso is expected to be completed by the end of this year. The campaigns in Mali and Niger are expected to finish in 2011. It is hoped that all countries in the meningitis belt will be using the vaccine by 2015."
Why start with mass vaccination campaigns?,"The goal of introducing the meningococcal A conjugate vaccine through mass vaccination campaigns of 1 to 29 year olds (the age group most at risk) is to immediately and drastically reduce carriage and transmission of the bacteria in order to rapidly reduce rates of death and illness caused by the disease. Because large population groups will be vaccinated in a short period of time, the benefits of immunization should be quickly visible; their impact is expected to be considerable.It is expected that future birth cohorts will be protected either through vaccination within the EPI schedule or through follow-up mass campaigns targeting 1-4 year-olds every five years."
Is there commitment in Africa for the introduction of this vaccine?,"Because of the prevalence of meningitis A in the population and the role it plays as a major cause of epidemics, controlling meningitis A has become an important public health priority in Africa. Countries in the meningitis belt have been eager to host the clinical trials of the vaccine and have contributed significantly to their success. The same enthusiasm now fuels introduction of the vaccine throughout the region. The first three countries to introduce MenAfriVac are contributing financially as much as national budgets allow."
Funding shortfalls and cost-savings: How much money will be required to eliminate epidemic meningitis as a public health problem in sub-Saharan Africa?,It is estimated that introduction of the vaccine in all meningitis belt countries will require the mobilization from donor governments and others of an additional US$ 475 million.It is hoped that the international community will supplement the national budgets of introducing countries to ensure that this funding gap is met.
Funding shortfalls and cost-savings: What are the expected cost savings due to introduction of this new vaccine?,"A very conservative estimate, looking only at treatment and vaccination, is probably a minimum of around US$20 million in an average year in Africa's meningitis belt. This does not include the expected economic impact of saving lives and preventing disabilities caused by epidemic meningitis. Nor does it include the expected impact of freeing up resources for essential health services, which are usually put on hold during the six to seven months of an epidemic."
Next steps - What are the Meningitis Vaccine Project's next steps?,"In addition to actively seeking funding that will guarantee vaccine introduction throughout the whole meningitis belt, MVP is working closely both with governments and institutions in the African region, and international partners, to monitor the effect of the new vaccine on the ground. The project is also conducting further clinical research to inform policy, in particular for infants, to determine how best to integrate the meningococcal A conjugate vaccine into existing routine immunization programmes in Africa."
What is the current risk of radiation-related health problems in Japan for those residing near the reactor in comparison to those in other parts of Japan?,"During the early phase of the nuclear emergency radiation-related health were dependant on exposure, which is turn were due to several things, including: the amount and type of radiation released from the reactor; weather conditions, such as wind and rain; a person’s proximity to the plant; and the amount of time spent in irradiated areas.The Government of Japan’s early actions in response to events at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant were in line with the existing recommendations for radiation exposure. The Government has evacuated individuals who were living within a 20-kilometre radius around the Fukushima Daiichi plant. Those living between 20 km and 30 km from the plant were asked to evacuate voluntarily. In general, people living farther away of the site of the event are at lower risk than those who live nearby.In light of evolving new information on levels of environmental radioactivity in the 20-30 km zone and some surrounding areas beyond the 30km zone, the Government of Japan established new planned evacuation zones from which residents were relocated to temporary housing based on the estimated cumulative doses they may receive in the 1 year following the accident.In addition, an emergency evacuation preparedness zone was also identified in which residents were asked to prepare their affairs in case they were asked to evacuate. These zones also follow administrative boundaries and extend beyond the 30 km radius."
Is there a risk of radioactive exposure from food contamination?,"Yes, there is a risk of exposure as a result of contamination in food.However, contaminated food would have to be consumed over prolonged periods to represent a risk to human health.The radioactive iodine and caesium in concentrations above the Japanese regulatory limits have been detected in some food commodities as a result of food monitoringJapanese authorities have advised residents to avoid these food and have implemented measures to prevent their sale and distribution."
Are there health risks to people living outside of Japan from radiation emitted into the atmosphere from damaged Japanese nuclear power plants?,"Thus far, there are no health risks to people living in other countries from radioactive material released into the atmosphere from the Japanese nuclear power plants. Radiation levels measured to date in other countries are far below the level of background radiation that most people are exposed to in every day circumstances.Radiation levels have been monitored by the Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO), which operates 63 surveillance stations around the world.Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO)"
Are people normally exposed to ionizing radiation?,"Human beings are exposed to natural radiation (also known as background radiation) on a daily basis. Natural radiation comes from space (i.e. cosmic rays) as well as from naturally-occurring radioactive materials found in the soil, water and air. Radon gas is a naturally-occurring gas that is the main source of natural radiation.People can also be exposed to radiation from man-made sources. Today, the most common man-made sources of ionizing radiation are X-ray machines and other medical devices.Radiation doses can be expressed in Sievert (Sv) units. On average, a person is exposed to approximately 3.0 milli Sieverts (mSv)/year, of which 80% (2.4 mSv) is due to naturally-occurring sources (i.e., background radiation), 19.6 % (almost 0.6 mSv) is due to the medical use of radiation and the remaining 0.4% (around 0.01 mSv) is due to other sources of human-made radiation.In some parts of the world, levels of exposure to natural radiation differ due to local geology. People in some areas can be exposed to more than 200 times the global average."
What is ionizing radiation?,"When certain atoms disintegrate, they release a type of energy called ionizing radiation. This energy can travel as either electromagnetic waves (i.e. gamma or X-rays) or as particles (i.e. alpha, beta or neutrons).The atoms that emit radiation are called radionuclides; e.g., radioactive iodine, caesium, and plutonium.Ionizing radiation is an essential tool for diagnosis and treatment in medicine, that must be used with rigorous attention to safety."
How are people exposed to ionizing radiation?,"Ionizing radiation may result from sources outside or inside of the body (i.e. external irradiation or internal contamination).External irradiation is produced when a person is exposed to external sources (i.e. X-rays) or when radioactive material (i.e. dust, liquid, or aerosols) becomes attached to skin or clothes.Internal contamination may result from breathing in or swallowing radioactive material or through contamination of wounds."
What type of radiation exposure could occur in a nuclear power plant accident?,"In the event a nuclear power plant does not function properly, individuals, land, and structures in the vicinity of the plant could be exposed to a mixture of radioactive products generated inside the reactor, also known as “nuclear fission products”. The main radionuclides representing health risk are radioactive caesium and radioactive iodine.Members of the public may be exposed directly to radionuclides, either in the air or if food and water become contaminated by these materials.Rescuers, first responders, and nuclear power plant workers may be exposed to radioactive materials and higher radiation doses inside or around the power plant due to their professional activities."
What is the WHO travel advice for Japan?,"WHO has not issued an advise on general restrictions regarding travel to Japan.During the early phase of the emergency, travellers were advised to avoid travel to the areas most affected by the earthquake and tsunami because of disruptions to essential services, such as transport and electric power. The ongoing disaster relief activities, including the nuclear power plant emergency response and control activities, would have made travel difficult and could have consumed resources needed by relief workers and residents. Moreover, as indicated by the Japanese authorities, travel within the evacuation and exclusion zones surrounding the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant was prohibited.In general, travellers who do not have essential reasons to travel were advised to give careful consideration to deferring travel to any areas where there had been considerable disruption to the normal infrastructure and where authorities were responding to urgent humanitarian needs.The situation in Japan has improved. Residents are being temporary allowed access into some areas that had been evacuated, but restrictions still exist. The Government of Japan is monitoring the situation and plans to lift restrictions once safety conditions are met.Information on the status of the nuclear facilities in Fukushima can be found on Japan’s Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency (NISA) website and on the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) website.Travellers should be aware of the risk of further earthquakes across Japan. Moreover, there may be areas of power, fuel, food and water shortages.International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)"
Do travellers returning from Japan represent a health risk for others?,"At this time, only those involved in the emergency response near the nuclear power plant remain in the area where there are higher levels of radioactivity. For their own safety, all personnel in these areas should undergo decontamination procedures when they leave the site. Travellers returning from Japan who have come from the 20 km evacuation zone surrounding the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant and who have undergone proper screening and decontamination procedures, and travellers from all other areas, do not pose a radioactive health risk to others and do not require screening."
What are the public health implications of global ageing?,"From 2000 until 2050, the world's population aged 60 and over 
will more than triple from 600 million to 2 billion. Most of this 
increase is occurring in less developed countries - where the number of 
older people will rise from 400 million in 2000 to 1.7 billion by 2050.
		This demographic change has several implications for public 
health. Good health is  key if older people are to remain independent 
and to play a part in family and community life. Life-long health 
promotion and disease prevention activities can prevent or delay the 
onset of noncommunicable and chronic diseases, such as heart disease, 
stroke and cancer. 

 But these diseases also need to be detected and treated early 
to minimize their consequences, and those who have an advanced disease 
will need decent long term care and support.  These services are best 
delivered through comprehensive primary care.Public health action can also draw on the capacities of older 
people. For example, the world's growing population of older people 
plays a critical role through volunteering, transmitting experience and 
knowledge, helping their families with caring responsibilities and 
increasing their participation in the paid labour force.Related linksOur ageing world"
What is thiomersal?,"Thiomersal is the most widely-used preservative for vaccines.
		Thiomersal is a compound containing ethyl mercury used to 
prevent bacterial and fungal growth in some inactivated vaccines in 
multi-dose vials. It is also used during production of specific vaccines, for 
example certain pertussis (whooping cough) vaccines, as part of the 
manufacturing process that makes the product safe and effective. 
Thiomersal has been  used  since the 1930s in the manufacture of some 
vaccines and other medicinal products."
Why do vaccines need preservatives?,"Preservatives inhibit growth of bacterial and fungal contaminants,
 which may be introduced during repeated use of a multi-dose vial. 
Multi-dose vials are used in many countries because they require less 
storage space in the cold-chain and lead to less wastage, both of which 
have a significant impact on programme costs. In many countries, for 
inactivated vaccines supplied in multi-dose vials, the presence of a 
preservative is a regulatory requirement."
Does the amount of thiomersal in vaccines pose a health risk ?,"WHO has closely monitored scientific evidence relating to the use 
of thiomersal as a vaccine preservative for over 10 years, in particular
 through its independent expert advisory group, the Global Advisory 
Committee on Vaccine Safety. The Committee has consistently reached the 
same conclusion: there is no evidence to suggest that the amount of 
thiomersal used in vaccines poses a health risk. Other expert groups 
(for example the U.S. Institute of Medicine, the American Academy of 
Pediatrics, the United Kingdom Committee on Safety of Medicine, and the 
European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products) have reached 
similar conclusions."
What would be the health impact of restricting thiomersal-containing vaccines ?,"Immunization with thiomersal-containing multi-dose vaccines 
currently protects at least 64% of all infants and children against four
 diseases with high mortality rates: diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis and Haemophilus influenzae
 type b. The use of thiomersal-containing vaccines to protect against 
these diseases averted  at least 1 400 000 child deaths in 2010. 
Thiomersal-containing vaccines are being used in over 120 countries. 
Removing thiomersal completely from vaccines would require either using 
alternative preservatives or using preservative-free single dose 
vaccines exclusively. Alternatives would incur significant costs for 
development and regulatory approval, thereby limiting the ability to 
offer affordable vaccines.
		Use of multi-dose vials is the most efficient and 
cost-effective way to protect populations when vaccines need to be 
administered to large numbers of people in a short space of time, such 
as in epidemic or pandemic situations."
What are the acute health effects of radiation exposure?,"If the dose of radiation exceeds a certain threshold level, it can produce acute effects, including skin redness, hair loss, radiation burns, and acute radiation syndrome (ARS).In a nuclear power plant accident, the general population is not likely to be exposed to doses high enough to cause such effects.Rescuers, first responders, and nuclear power plant workers are more likely to be exposed to doses of radiation high enough to cause acute effects."
What long-term effects can be expected from radiation exposure?,"Exposure to ionizing doses of radiation can increase the risk of cancer.Radioactive iodine can be released during nuclear emergencies. If radioactive iodine is breathed in or swallowed, it will concentrate in the thyroid gland and increase the risk of thyroid cancer. Among persons exposed to radioactive iodine, the risk of thyroid cancer can be lowered by taking potassium iodide pills, which helps prevent the uptake of the radioactive iodine.The risk of thyroid cancer following radiation exposure is higher in children and young adults."
Does radiation exposure pose a risk to foetuses?,"Foetuses are at risk of brain damage from radiation during weeks 8-25 of gestation.Studies have shown brain damage in foetuses following exposure to an acute dose of radiation exceeding 100 mSv during weeks 8-15 and an acute dose exceeding 200 mSv during weeks 16-25. Outside of weeks 8-25, studies have not shown radiation risk to the fetal brain.Foetal exposure to radiation can increase the risk of cancer in childhood. Studies have shown this effect with doses above 100 mSv.Dose comparisons for ionising radiationHealth Protection Agency (UK) web site"
What emotional impact can a nuclear accident have on children?How can they be assisted?,"Disasters and their aftermath can have a profound emotional impact on children and may result in long term behavioural disturbances. Children exhibiting signs of stress - including difficulty sleeping, loss of appetite, developing new fears, changes in behavior (e.g. clinging, bedwetting), being preoccupied with the crisis - should receive extra time and attention from family members and other caregivers.Children are among the most vulnerable of those affected by a nuclear accident because of their inability to fully understand and process the immediate and long-term effects of the emergency. Family members and caregivers should try to find out what the child thinks and feels about the disaster. If the child is scared because she/he has misunderstood what has happened, then simple explanations should be provided while avoiding alarming details. Children need a chance to play and relax. Encourage older children to be helpful and maintain regular routines.Reactions to stress can depend on developmental level and are generally marked by changes in typical behavior for a specific child or adolescent. Reactions may continue for days, weeks or even months. Children should see a paediatrician or mental health professional if anxiety or grief interferes with their daily functioning, or if these emotions do not reduce with time. Early management of these symptoms can speed recovery and prevent long-term consequences.Mental Health and Psychosocial Support in Emergency Settings (English version) [pdf, 816KB]Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC) GuidelinesTriage, Monitoring and Treatment of people exposed to ionizing radiationTMT Hand book Triage, Monitoring and Treatment of people exposed to ionizing radiation following a malevolent act (2009).

Which public health actions are most important to take?,"Health effects can only occur if someone is exposed to radiation, thus the main protective action someone can take is to prevent exposure. Those closest to the radiation source are at greatest risk of exposure and the greater the distance away, the lower the risk.In the early phase of a nuclear emergency (within the first hours/days), urgent protective actions may be implemented to prevent radiation exposure, taking into account projected doses that people may received in the short-term (e.g. within 2-7 days). These necessary actions depend on the estimated exposure (i.e., the amount of radioactivity released into the atmosphere and the prevailing meteorological conditions, such as wind and rain. Actions may include: evacuation of the area around or near the nuclear power plant; advising people to shelter in their homes, offices, other secure buildings or designated shelters to reduce exposure; and distributing and administering potassium iodide pills to reduce the risk of thyroid cancer).When environmental and human monitoring data increases, relocation of people to temporary housing may be considered in particular areas, taking into account the radiation doses that residents may receive over the long-term (e.g. one year),.If warranted, public health or national authorities may restrict or prohibit the consumption of vegetables and dairy products produced in the vicinity of the nuclear power plant in order to reduce exposure. Monitoring programs are established to inform longer term decisions on food restriction, water consumption, and the control of internationally traded foodstuffs.Only competent authorities who have conducted a careful analysis of the emergency situation are in a position to recommend which of these public health measures should be undertaken."
How can I protect myself?,"Keep informed by obtaining accurate and authoritative information (e.g., information from authorities delivered by radio, TV or the Internet) and following your government's instructions.The decision to take potassium iodide should be based on information provided by national health authorities who will be in the best position to determine if this step is warranted."
"If I have been exposed to radioactive material released into the environment, what should I do?","If you are coming indoors after exposure to radioactive material, undress in the doorway to avoid further contamination in your home or shelter. Remove clothing and shoes and place them in a plastic bag. Seal the bag and place it in a safe location away from living areas, children, and pets.Shower or bathe with warm water and soap.Notify authorities that you may have contaminated clothing and personal belongings to be handled appropriately and disposed of according to accepted national procedures."
"When people are advised to stay indoors, what does this mean?","When a radiological or nuclear event occurs, public health authorities may order residents in the affected areas to stay indoors rather than evacuate. You may be advised to take shelter at home, at work, or in public shelters. Shelter can provide protection from external exposure and from inhalation of radioactive material.If you are advised to stay indoors, you should find the safest room in your house or office building: if possible, one which has no windows and no external doors. Ventilation systems, such as heating and cooling systems, should be shut down.In sub-zero temperatures, it is important to keep warm. If you have been instructed to shelter in your home, office, or other structure, it may not be safe to burn fuels—such as gas, coal, or wood—to keep warm. Doing so may result in carbon monoxide poisoning, which can occur when rooms are not adequately ventilated. If it is available, electrical forms of heating are safer."
What are potassium iodide pills?,"Potassium iodide pills are a source of stable (i.e. non-radioactive) iodine. The thyroid gland requires iodine to produce thyroid hormones. The presence of stable iodine in the body in an appropriate amount blocks the thyroid from absorbing radioactive iodine (radioiodine), reducing the risk of thyroid cancer which may follow from exposure to radioiodine.Potassium iodide pills are not “radiation antidotes”. They do not protect against external radiation, or against any other radioactive substances besides radioiodine. They may also cause medical complications for some individuals with poorly functioning kidneys. Potassium iodide should be taken only when there is a clear public health recommendation."
When and why should I take potassium iodide?,"You should only take potassium iodide when it is recommended by public health authorities. If you are at risk or have been exposed to radioiodine, potassium iodide pills may be given to protect the thyroid gland from uptake of radioiodine. This can reduce the risk of thyroid cancer in the long run, when given before or shortly after exposure."
"Why are some tropical diseases called ""neglected""?","The people who are most affected by these diseases are often 
the poorest populations, living in remote, rural areas, urban slums or 
conflict zones. Neglected tropical diseases persist under conditions of 
poverty and are concentrated almost exclusively in impoverished 
populations in the developing world. 
		Lacking a strong political voice, people affected by these 
tropical diseases have a low profile and status in public health 
priorities. Lack of reliable statistics and unpronounceable names of 
diseases have all hampered efforts to bring them out of the shadows. 
They include dengue, rabies, blinding trachoma, Buruli ulcer, endemic 
treponematoses (yaws), leprosy (Hansen disease), Chagas disease, human 
African trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness), leishmaniasis, 
cysticercosis, dracunculiasis (guinea-worm disease), echinococcosis, 
foodborne trematode infections, lymphatic filariasis, onchocerciasis 
(river blindness), schistosomiasis (bilharziasis), soil-transmitted 
helminthiases (intestinal worms).Neglected tropical diseases affect more than 1 billion people,
 primarily poor populations living in tropical and subtropical climates.
 They are frequently clustered together geographically and individuals 
are often afflicted with more than one parasite or infection. More than 
70% of countries and territories that report the presence of neglected 
tropical diseases are low-income or lower middle-income economies.Infections are caused by unsafe water, poor housing conditions
 and poor sanitation. Children are the most vulnerable to these 
diseases, which kill, impair or permanently disable millions of people 
every year, often resulting in life-long physical pain and social 
stigmatization. 
There is reason to be optimistic, however. Many neglected 
tropical diseases can be prevented, eliminated or even eradicated with 
improved access to existing safe and cost-effective tools. Control 
relies on simple interventions that can be carried out by 
non-specialists -- for example schoolteachers, village heads and local 
volunteers -- in community-based preventive action.

Why are malaria mortality rates different in recent studies?,"An article in The Lancet on 3 February 2012 estimated that 
1.24 million people died of malaria in 2010 while for the same year, WHO
 estimated 655 000 people died.  WHO is grateful for efforts of all partners to improve estimates on malaria and other diseases in public health.
It is well appreciated in the public health community that 
estimates are very much influenced by the study sites, data, assumptions
 and methodology used in their studies. In this study, the variation in 
estimates of deaths over the age of 5 is because different methodologies
 were used. WHO stands by their previous estimates that were based on the 
methodology developed by the UN agency in collaboration with other 
partners. WHO welcomes the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation’s
  estimates that actually show more similarities than differences.  Both
 approaches show that an unacceptably high number of people still die 
from malaria. The trends in disease are steadily downward by both 
methods, thanks to investments in scaling up life-saving tools. To improve disease estimates in the future, it is imperative 
that resource-constrained countries be supported to develop robust 
health information systems. This includes accurate diagnosis of causes 
of deaths; and that all experts working on disease estimates work 
together more collaboratively to produce accurate and timely data.  This
 information is critical for the decision-making that ensures public 
health interventions reach the right communities and have the greatest 
potential of helping more people live longer, healthier lives."
Should I take iodized salt to protect myself from radiation?,"No, you should not take iodized salt to protect yourself from radiation. It is dangerous to take large amounts of iodized salt in order to increase the amount of stable iodine in the body.Increasing one's daily intake of iodized salt will cause more harm than good. The main ingredient of iodized salt is sodium chloride, which is linked with hypertension (high blood pressure) and other medical disorders. The iodine content in iodized salt is too low to prevent uptake of radioiodine.Sodium chloride is acutely toxic in large amounts: even tablespoon quantities of salt repeatedly taken over a short period of time could cause poisoning."
Can I take other forms of iodine?,"No, you should not take products that contain iodine, other than medicines recommended by public health authorities.Iodine is found in a variety of household and industrial products. For example, iodine may be found in some disinfectants, antiseptics, and water-sterilizing solutions. These products should not be taken as an alternative to potassium iodide pills, because such products contain other ingredients that can be harmful if swallowed."
Can pregnant women take potassium iodide pills?,"Yes, most pregnant women can take potassium iodide pills, following the instructions of public health authorities. Potassium iodide will cross the placenta and protect the thyroid of the growing foetus, as well as the mother."
What are the recommendations for breastfeeding women regarding potassium iodide?,"As with the rest of the population, breastfeeding women should take potassium iodide tablets only when advised by public health authorities. However, this will not be sufficient to fully protect the breastfed child who will need potassium iodide as well, in special doses adapted for newborns and infants.Under these conditions, breastfeeding can continue."
Can food produced in other countries be affected by the events in Japan?,"Radioactive material has been released into the environment from damaged Japanese nuclear power plants. Radiation levels measured to date in other countries are far below the level of background radiation that most people are exposed to in every day circumstances and do not present health or transportation safety hazards, according to the United Nations organizations closely monitoring the situation.Minute amounts of radioactive caesium and iodine might be found using very sensitive detection methods but this should not affect foods produced in other countries as the amounts involved will be well below acceptable levels and would not pose a health concern to those who eat the food."
What are the potential health effects of consuming contaminated food?,"Consuming food contaminated with radioactive material will increase the amount of radioactivity a person is exposed to and could increase the health risks associated with exposure to radiation. The exact effect will depend on which radionuclides have been ingested and the amount. According to data reported so far, radioactive iodine and caesium are the main contaminants, and concentrations in some food samples have been detected at levels above the Japanese regulatory limits.Radioactive iodine has a half-life of eight days and decays naturally within weeks. If ingested, it can accumulate in the body, particularly the thyroid gland, and increase the risk of thyroid cancer, particularly in children.The ingestion of potassium iodide is an established method to prevent the accumulation of radioactive iodine in the thyroid.Radioactive caesium has a half-life longer than that of radioactive iodine (up to 30 years).and can stay in the environment for many years. Like all radionuclides, exposure to radiation from radioactive caesium can result in a increased risk of cancer."
Is all food production in Japan affected by the nuclear emergency?,"No, not all foods will be affected. Food that was dispatched or commercially packaged before the emergency situation would not be affected. However, some food produced in areas where radioactive material has been deposited has been found to be contaminated. This is why the Japanese authorities have instituted monitoring and are taking measures to address the issue."
What impact will this have on food and food production in Japan?,"The impact on food and food production in Japan will depend upon the types of radionuclides and the amount of radioactivity deposited or present where food is being produced or harvested. Although radioactive iodine in food is of immediate concern after nuclear emergencies, it has a relatively short half-life and will naturally decay over a short time frame. Radioactive caesium has also been detected in food. In contrast to radioactive iodine, radioactive caesium can linger in the environment for many years and could continue to present a longer term problem for food, and food production, and a threat to human health."
How do food products become radioactive?,"Foods can become contaminated with radioactive materials when they are released as the result of a nuclear or radiological emergency. In these circumstances, radioactive material falling from the air or carried in rain water or snow, can deposit on the surface of foods like fruits and vegetables or animal feed. Also, over time, radioactivity can build up within food, as radionuclides are transferred through soil into crops or animals. Radioactivity can also be washed into rivers, lakes and the sea where fish and seafood could take up the radionuclides. The severity of the risk depends on the radionuclide mix and the level of contaminant released.Radioactivity cannot contaminate food that is packaged; for example, tinned or plastic-wrapped food is protected from radioactivity as long as the food is sealed."
Why is food affected in areas beyond the evacuation zone?,"During a nuclear emergency, an evacuation zone is established to prevent people from being exposed to immediate and unacceptable levels of radiation posing a threat to human health. However, contamination of food can occur through uptake from soil to crops, or to animals through feed, even when levels of radioactive contamination are lower than those which might pose a direct threat to human health. The standards for acceptable limits for radioactivity in food are set at low levels in order to take into account the possibility of contaminated food being eaten over an extended period of time and resulting in a cumulative dose."
Are there rules for radioactivity in foods for international trade?,"There are internationally agreed Codex Guideline Levels (GLs) for radionuclide levels in internationally traded food following a nuclear or radiological emergency. These GLs are published by the Joint FAO/WHO Codex Alimentarius Commission.The GLs state that, “as far as generic radiological protection of food consumers is concerned, when radionuclide levels in food do not exceed the corresponding Guideline Level, the food should be considered as safe for human consumption. When the Guideline Levels are exceeded, national governments shall decide whether and under what circumstances the food should be distributed within their territory or jurisdiction. National governments may wish to adopt different values for internal use within their own territories, where the assumptions concerning food distribution that have been made to derive the Guideline Levels may not apply, e.g., in the case of widespread radioactive contamination. For foods that are consumed in small quantities, such as spices, that represent a small percentage of total diet and hence a small addition to the total dose, the Guideline Levels may be increased by a factor of 10”.GLs for radionuclide levels can be found in the Codex General Standard for Contaminants and Toxins in Food and Feed – (CODEX STAN 193-1995)Codex General Standard for Contaminants and Toxins in Food and Feed(CODEX STAN 193-1995)"
What is the deadliest disease in the world?,"The results of ranking the leading causes of death are subject to the cause categories used. The broader the cause categories used, the more likely they will rank among the top leading causes of death.
    According to the estimates in the Causes of death 2008 update, there were 57 million deaths in the world in 2008. The broad category of all ""noncommunicable diseases"" killed 36 million people; communicable diseases, maternal and perinatal
        conditions, and nutritional conditions killed 16 million people worldwide; and external causes of injuries killed 5 million people.The following are the leading causes of death:"
Why is smoking an issue for non-smokers?,"There are some 4000 known chemicals in tobacco smoke; at least 
250 of them are known to be harmful and more than 50 are known to cause 
cancer in humans. Tobacco smoke in enclosed spaces is breathed in by 
everyone, exposing smokers and nonsmokers alike to its harmful effects.
		Around 700 million children, or almost half of the world's 
total, breathe air polluted by tobacco smoke. Over 40% of children have 
at least one smoking parent. In 2004, children accounted for 31% of the 
600 000 premature deaths attributable to second-hand smoke.In adults, second-hand smoke causes serious cardiovascular and
 respiratory diseases, including coronary heart disease and lung cancer.
 In infants, it causes sudden death syndrome. In pregnant women, it 
causes low birth weight. 

Neither ventilation nor filtration, even in combination, can 
reduce tobacco smoke exposure indoors to levels that are considered 
acceptable. Only 100% smoke-free environments provide effective 
protection. Contrary to common belief, smoke-free environments are 
widely supported by both smokers and nonsmokers. Having a smoke-free environment often saves money for bars and
 restaurant owners, reducing their risks of fire and consequently their 
insurance costs. It often results in lower renovation, cleaning and 
maintenance costs, too. 

Article 8 of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, 
recognizes that exposure to tobacco smoke causes death, disease and 
disability, and asks countries to adopt and implement legislation that 
provides protection from second-hand smoke. 

Many countries around the world have already introduced laws

"What are the key health dangers for children, and what is WHO doing to address them?","Nearly 6.9 million children under the age of five died in 2011 – nearly 800 every hour – but most could survive threats and thrive with access to simple, affordable interventions.The risk of death is highest in the first month of life. Preterm birth, birth asphyxia and infections cause most newborn deaths. Health risks to newborns are minimized by:quality care during pregnancy;safe delivery by a skilled birth attendant; andstrong neonatal care: immediate attention to breathing and warmth, hygienic cord and skin care, and early initiation of exclusive breastfeeding.From one month to five years of age, the main causes of death are pneumonia, diarrhoea, malaria and measles. Malnutrition is estimated to contribute to more than one third of all child deaths.Pneumonia is the prime cause of death in children under five years of age. Addressing the major risk factors – including malnutrition and indoor air pollution – is essential to preventing pneumonia, as are vaccination and breastfeeding. Antibiotics and oxygen are vital tools for effectively managing the illness.Diarrhoeal diseases are a leading cause of sickness and death among children in developing countries. Breastfeeding helps prevent diarrhoea among young children. Treatment for sick children with Oral Rehydration Salts (ORS) combined with zinc supplements is safe, cost-effective, and saves lives.One child dies every minute from malaria. Insecticide-treated nets prevent transmission and increase child survival.Over 90% of children with HIV are infected through mother-to-child transmission; this can be prevented with antiretrovirals, as well as safer delivery and feeding practices.Worldwide, about 20% of deaths among children under-five could be avoided if feeding guidelines are followed. WHO recommends exclusive breastfeeding for six months, introducing age-appropriate and safe complementary foods at six months, and continuing breastfeeding for up to two years or beyond.About two-thirds of child deaths are preventable through practical, low-cost interventions. WHO is improving child health by helping countries to deliver integrated, effective care in a continuum - starting with a healthy pregnancy for the mother, through birth and care up to five years of age. Investing in strong health systems is key to prevention and delivery of quality care."
What are the early indications of age related hearing loss (presbycusis)?,"In the initial stages, a person with hearing loss may have difficulty in understanding words. He/she is often able to hear the sounds but unable to make out the words. This may be more evident when the background noise is high (eg in a restaurant).
Such a person may also start speaking in a louder voice than normal, without being aware of it.
A ringing sensation in the ear (tinnitus) and inability to hear high pitched sounds can also indicate presbycusis."
When should I get my ears tested?,"You should get your ears tested if:

you often have to ask people to repeat themselves
find yourself raising the volume of the television to higher than normal levels
regularly miss parts of conversations
experience a ringing sensation in the ear (tinnitus)
people tell you that you are speaking loudly."
Can age-related hearing loss be reversed? Can it be treated?,"Age related hearing loss cannot be reversed, as it is caused by degeneration of sensory cells, which occurs with age. However, it can be treated effectively by use of hearing aids and other communication devices."
What measures can help me to prevent or delay the onset of hearing loss in my old age?,"Taking good care of your ears and following good ear and hearing practices such as:

protecting your ears from loud sounds;
never inserting anything into your ear or instill any liquids, other than medicines prescribed by a trained health care personnel;
in case of pain in the ear or ear-discharge, seeking medical treatment urgently;
eating healthy food and exercising well to avoid diseases such as hypertension and diabetes, that predispose to development of hearing loss; and
avoiding cigarette smoking."
My parents have hearing loss. What care should I take when speaking with them?,"When you speak to a person with hearing loss, make sure that:

you face them while speaking
your face is neither covered nor in the dark when you speak
don't speak with your mouth full
speak in a loud, clear voice, but don't shout
try to minimize the background noise by turning off the television or radio."
What are the health consequences of being overweight?,"The latest WHO projections indicate that at least one in three 
 of the world's adult population is overweight and almost one in 10 is 
obese. Additionally there are over 40 million children under age five 
who are overweight.
		Being overweight or obese can have a serious impact on health.
 Carrying extra fat leads to serious health consequences such as 
cardiovascular disease (mainly heart disease and stroke), type 2 
diabetes, musculoskeletal disorders like osteoarthritis, and some 
cancers (endometrial, breast and colon). These conditions cause 
premature death and substantial disability. What is not widely known is that the risk of health problems 
starts when someone is only very slightly overweight, and that the 
likelihood of problems increases as someone becomes more and more 
overweight. Many of these conditions cause long-term suffering for 
individuals and families. In addition, the costs for the health care 
system can be extremely high. The good news is that overweight and obesity are largely 
preventable. The key to success is to achieve an energy balance between 
calories consumed on one hand, and calories used on the other hand. To reach this goal, people can limit energy intake from total 
fats and shift fat consumption away from saturated fats to unsaturated 
fats; increase consumption of fruit and vegetables, as well as legumes, 
whole grains and nuts; and limit their intake of sugars. And to increase
 calories used,  people can boost  their levels of physical activity - 
to at least 30 minutes of regular, moderate-intensity activity on most 
days. Related linksDiet and physical activity: a public health priority"
What actions are being taken to monitor the safety of food from Japan?,"In response to the nuclear accident in Japan, Japanese authorities have instituted monitoring of food products and have restricted the consumption and distribution of some products in certain prefectures, or areas found to contain radionuclides exceeding Japan's provisional regulation value. Findings from food monitoring in Japan and decisions related to the consumption and distribution of food products are published regularly on the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare web site.Many countries have implemented food control measures to mirror actions taken within Japan. Some countries have indicated they now require documentation verifying the safety of products and/or the prefecture of origin of the food. Other countries have suspended food imports from Japan. In addition, many countries have increased monitoring on foods imported from Japan.Japan Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare"
What general advice can be given to food consumers and producers in the event of a nuclear emergency?,"The response to an emergency involving radioactivity should be the same as the response to any emergency involving any hazardous material contaminating food. In the early stages of an emergency, and if it is safe to do so, it is possible to take immediate actions to prevent or minimize the contamination of food by radiological materials. For example, it is possible to do the following:protect food and animal fodder which is stored in the open; cover with plastic sheets or impermeable tarpaulins;close the ventilation of greenhouses to protect growing vegetables;bring livestock in from pastures and move animals into a shed or barn;harvest any ripe crops and place under cover before any fallout has been recorded; anddon’t harvest after fallout – wait for further instructions after contamination has been recorded.Many other short-, medium- and long-term actions need to be considered in areas confirmed to be seriously contaminated, such as:avoid consumption of locally produced milk or vegetables;avoid slaughtering animals;avoid consumption and harvesting of aquatic animals and plants (including fish, shellfish, and algae); andavoid hunting or gathering mushrooms or other wild or collected foods.Additional information on emergency preparedness and responseJoint FAO/IAEA Programme"
Can I drink the tap water in Japan?,"Drinking tap water in Japan poses no immediate health riskThe Japanese authorities closely monitored the situation and issued advice, when needed, against consumption of tap water, including specific recommendations for infants. Essential hydration of infants should not be compromised in an attempt to reduce exposure to radionuclide contamination.The standards adopted by the Japanese authorities for this emergency are precautionary. In the case of radioactive iodine the standard for adults is 300 Becquerels per litre in drinking-water. In the very unlikely scenario that drinking-water was contaminated and consumed for an entire year at this level, the additional radiation exposure from this water would be equivalent to natural background radiation during one year.During the early phase of the emergency WHO urged people in the area to heed the advice of local authorities, as they have access to the latest measurements of radiation levels in water to compare against the standards for adults and children. Currently, restrictions of consumption of tap water have been lifted in all prefectures."
Can radioactive contamination be removed from water?,Standard water treatment procedures may remove significant amounts of radioactive contaminants. Other options to reduce concentrations of radiation contaminants include controlled dilution of contaminated water with non-contaminated water.Boiling water will not remove radioactive iodine.
Why do the guidance levels for radioactive Iodine-131 in drinking water vary?,"The guidance levels found in different sets of recommendations vary because some apply to routine situations and others to emergency situations. The table below summarizes the guidance on radioactive Iodine-131 in drinking water and provides an indication of the equivalent exposure from routine activities.Guideline nameAdvised maximum levels for radioactive activity in water (Bq/L)Approximate equivalent radiation exposure if consuming water at this activity level for a yearWHO Guidelines for Drinking-water Quality (1)10A New York - London flightJapanese provisional (emergency) standard for adults (2)300One year's exposure to natural background radiation, or 10-15 chest X-raysJapanese provisional (emergency) standard for infants (3)100IAEA Operational Intervention Level for nuclear emergencies (4)3000Not applicable. The advised maximum level should be used only to trigger action in the early stages of the emergency(1) WHO Guidelines for Drinking-water Quality should not be taken as the reference point for nuclear emergencies because the levels set are extremely conservative, and designed to apply to lifetime routine intake.(2) Provisional regulation values relating to limits on food and drink ingestion, established by the Japanese Food Sanitation Act, as indicated by the Nuclear Safety Commission of Japan. These standards are precautionary and have taken international guidance into consideration, including recommendations of the IAEA and the International Commission on Radiological Protection.(3) As in (2) above, but applicable to drinking-water used to prepare baby food. This level is equivalent to the international guideline set by Codex Alimentarius for infant food.(4) IAEA Safety Guide GSG-2 established Operational Intervention Levels (OILs) which would be the default international guidance levels for the early stage of an emergency."
What is WHO's role in nuclear emergencies?,"In accordance with its Constitution and the International Health Regulations, WHO is mandated to assess public health risks and provide technical consultation and assistance in association with public health events, including those associated with radiation events. In doing so, WHO is working with independent experts and other UN agencies.WHO's work is supported by a global network comprising more than 40 specialized institutions in radiation emergency medicine. The network, the Radiation Emergency Medical Preparedness and Assistance Network (REMPAN), provides technical assistance for radiation emergency preparedness and response."
What is e-accessibility?,"Electronic accessibility, or E-Accessibility, refers to the 
ease of use of information and communication technologies (ICTs), such 
as the Internet, by people with disability. Web sites need to be 
developed so that disabled users can access the information. For 
example:
for people who are blind, web sites need to be able to be 
interpreted by programmes which read text aloud and describe any visual 
images; for people who have low vision, web pages need adjustable sized fonts and sharply contrasting colours; and for people who are deaf or hard of hearing, audio content should 
be accompanied by text versions of the dialogue. Sign language video can
 also help make audio content more accessible.
	 
Internationally, the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, 
prepared by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) provide standards for 
web accessibility. The Convention on the Rights of Persons with 
Disabilities, which came into force on May 3, 2008 draws attention to 
the need to ensure access to ICTs for people with disability on an 
equal basis with others and will help to eliminate barriers to 
information, including through the Internet. At the national level, laws
 and regulations can promote compliance with accessibility standards.The use of ICTs, such as the Internet, is rapidly becoming an 
essential part of the economic, educational and social life of many 
people today. Therefore it is vital that web sites can  be used by all, 
so that  people with disability have the same access to information 
as everyone else.Related linksWeb content accessibility guidelines"
What are the health risks associated with mobile phones and their base stations?,"This is a question which WHO takes very seriously. Given the 
immense number of people who use mobile phones, even a small increase in
 the incidence of adverse effects on health could have major public 
health implications. 
		Because exposure to the radiofrequency (RF) fields emitted by 
mobile phones is generally more than a 1000 times higher than from base 
stations, and the greater likelihood of any adverse effect being due to 
handsets, research has almost exclusively been conducted on possible 
effects of mobile phone exposure. Research has concentrated on the following areas: cancerother health effectselectromagnetic interferencetraffic accidents. CancerBased on mixed epidemiological evidence on humans regarding an
 association between exposure to RF radiation from wireless phones and 
head cancers (glioma and acoustic neuroma), RF fields have been 
classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer as 
possibly carcinogenic to humans (Group 2B). Studies to date provide no 
indication that environmental exposure to RF fields, such as from base 
stations, increases the risk of cancer or any other disease. Other health effectsScientists have reported other health effects of using mobile 
phones including changes in brain activity, reaction times, and sleep 
patterns. These effects are minor and have no apparent health 
significance. More studies are underway to try to confirm these 
findings. Electromagnetic interferenceWhen mobile phones are used very close to some medical devices
 (including pacemakers, implantable defibrillators, and certain hearing 
aids) there is the possibility of causing interference with their 
operation. The risk is much reduced for 3G phones and newer equipment. 
There is also the potential of interference between mobile phones 
signals and aircraft electronics. Some countries have licensed mobile 
phone use on aircraft during flight using systems that control the phone
 output power.Traffic accidentsResearch has shown an increased risk of traffic accidents, 
some 3-4 times greater chance of an accident, when mobile phones (either
 handheld or with a ""hands-free"" kit) are used while driving due to 
distraction. ConclusionsWhile an increased risk of brain tumours from the use of 
mobile phones is not established, the increasing use of mobile phones 
and the lack of data for mobile phone use over time periods longer than 
15 years warrant further research of mobile phone use and brain cancer 
risk. In particular, with the recent popularity of mobile phone use 
among younger people, and therefore a potentially longer lifetime of 
exposure, WHO has promoted further research on this group and is 
currently assessing the health impact of RF fields on all studied 
endpoints."
Is it true that lack of iodine really causes brain damage?,"Iodine deficiency is the main cause of brain damage in 
childhood. It results in impaired cognitive and motor development which 
affects a child’s performance at school. In adulthood, it affects 
productivity and the ability to find a job. Iodine-deficient people may 
forfeit 15 IQ points, and nearly 50 million people suffer from some 
degree of iodine deficiency-related brain damage.
		It is particularly important that pregnant women receive 
enough iodine in their diet, as iodine is a key nutrient in the fetal 
development process, especially with respect to the brain. Iodine 
deficiency during pregnancy not only results in brain damage to the 
fetus, but also in low birth weight, prematurity and increased perinatal
 and infant mortality. Young children are also particularly at risk because the brain
 still needs iodine for its development during the first two years of 
life. In addition, iodine deficiency in children is responsible for 
disorders in physical and cognitive development, and hypothyroidism.

The latest global estimate is that 1.88 billion people, 
including 241 million school-age children have insufficient dietary 
iodine intake (1). Even if iodine deficiency may be more severe in 
developing countries, it equally affects developed and developing 
countries.Iodine deficiency can easily be prevented at low cost. One of 
the best and least expensive methods of preventing iodine deficiency 
disorder is by simply iodizing table salt, which is currently done in 
many countries. Where salt iodization has been in place for at least a 
year, improvement in iodine status within the population has been 
overwhelming. It is because of these adverse effects on brain development 
that the 58th World Health Assembly passed a resolution to urge a 
renewed effort from the international community, including WHO and 
UNICEF, to address iodine deficiency in the 54 countries most affected. 
Efforts include:developing strong commitment from public heath authoritieseducation of the publiceffective collaboration with all partners involved especially the salt industrya good monitoring system to make sure that salt is adequately iodizednational legislations on iodized salt that are enforced.

What is a refractive error?,"A refractive error is a very common eye disorder. It occurs 
when the eye cannot clearly focus the images from the outside world. The
 result of refractive errors is blurred vision, which is sometimes so 
severe that it causes visual impairment.
		The four most common refractive errors are:myopia (nearsightedness): difficulty in seeing distant objects clearly;hyperopia (farsightedness): difficulty in seeing close objects clearly; astigmatism: distorted vision resulting from an irregularly curved cornea, the clear covering of the eyeball.presbyopia: which leads to difficulty in reading or seeing at 
arm's length, it is linked to ageing and occurs almost universally.Refractive errors cannot be prevented, but they can be 
diagnosed by an eye examination and treated with corrective glasses, 
contact lenses or refractive surgery. If corrected in time and by 
eye-care professionals, they do not impede the full development of good 
visual function. Correction is provided in different forms according to 
the defect, the age f the person, the requirements in terms of work of 
activity performed.

WHO estimates that 153 million people worldwide live with 
visual impairment due to uncorrected refractive errors. This figure does
 not include the people living with uncorrected presbyopia, which is 
likely to be quite significant, according to some early evidence.WHO, its Member States and partners are working to find ways 
to provide good quality, professionally prescribed, local, affordable 
corrective  refraction services to people in need, especially in poor 
areas with limited eye care services.Related linksBlindness and Vision"
What is chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)?,"Although relatively few people have heard of it, chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) kills on average one person every 
10 seconds.
		COPD is not one single disease but an umbrella term used to 
describe chronic lung diseases that cause limitations in lung airflow. 
It is not a simple smoker's cough, but an under-diagnosed, life 
threatening lung disease. The most common symptoms of COPD are 
breathlessness, or a 'need for air', excessive sputum production, and a 
chronic cough. Daily activities, such as walking up a short flight of 
stairs, may become very difficult as the disease worsens. COPD is preventable, but not curable. Treatment can help slow 
disease progression, but COPD generally worsens slowly over time.  
Because of this, it is most frequently diagnosed in people aged 40 years
 or older. Chronic bronchitis and emphysema are terms that are no longer
 used and are now included within the COPD diagnosis.According to WHO estimates, 64 million people have COPD and 3 
million people died of COPD in 2004. Total deaths from COPD are 
projected to increase in the next 20 years, making it the third leading 
cause of death in the world unless urgent action is taken to reduce 
underlying risk factors, especially tobacco use and air pollution."
Q: What health challenges do preterm babies face?,"The earlier in a pregnancy that babies are born, the less prepared their bodies are for the outside world. They need special care to overcome the following challenges:Staying warm: Preterm babies lose body heat more easily, putting them at risk of life-threatening hypothermia. They need extra energy and care to stay warm and grow.Feeding: Preterm babies can have trouble feeding because the coordinated suck and swallow reflex is not yet fully developed. They may need additional support for feeding.Breathing: Many preterm babies start breathing on their own when they are born, but others need to be resuscitated. If the lungs are not fully developed and lack surfactant (a substance that helps keep the lungs expanded), preterm babies may have difficulty breathing. Sometimes, premature babies that start off breathing are not strong enough to continue on their own. They exhaust themselves and may stop breathing (apnoea).Infections: Severe infections are more common among preterm babies. Their immune systems are not yet fully developed, and they have a higher risk of dying if they get an infection.Brain: Preterm babies are at risk of bleeding in the brain, during birth and in the first few days after birth; about 1 in 5 babies weighing less than 2kg have this problem. Preterm babies can also have brain injuries from a lack of oxygen. Bleeding or lack of oxygen to the brain can result in result in cerebral palsy, developmental delays and learning difficulties.Eyes: Preterm babies’ eyes are not ready for the outside world. They can be damaged by abnormal growth of blood vessels in the retina. The condition is usually more severe in very premature babies and if they are given too-high a level of oxygen. This can result in visual impairment or blindness."
Q: What are the consequences of preterm birth later in life?,"Preterm babies are at risk of developing disabilities that will affect them for their entire lives. The extent to which this will affect their life strongly depends on how early they were born, the quality of care they received during and around birth and the days and weeks that follow."
Why is the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities important?,"People with disability are often denied chances to work, go 
to school and participate fully in society - which creates barriers for 
their prosperity and well being. The Convention on the Rights of Persons
 with Disabilities is important because it is a tool for ensuring that 
people with disability have access to the same rights and 
opportunities as everybody else. There are around 1 billion people with 
disability in the world. They are often the poorest of the poor. The 
stigma and discrimination they suffer are common in all societies. 
		The Convention is a human rights treaty designed by 
representatives of the international community - including people with 
disability, government officials, representatives of nongovernmental 
organizations and others - to change the way people with disability are viewed and treated in their societies. Rather than considering disability as an issue of medicine, 
charity or dependency, the Convention challenges people worldwide to 
understand disability as a human rights issue. The Convention covers 
many areas where obstacles can arise, such as physical access to 
buildings, roads and transportation, and access to information through 
written and electronic communications. The Convention also aims to 
reduce stigma and discrimination, which are often reasons why people 
with disability are excluded from education, employment and health and
 other services.   

For the first time, a legally binding international instrument
 now exists to guarantee that States that have ratified the treaty will 
promote and protect the rights of people with disability. These States
 will next work on passing their own national civil rights legislation 
to improve the lives of people with disability."
Q: What kind of care do preterm babies need?,"Babies who are born preterm need the same care that other babies get and a little more. This includes:Good pregnancy care:All pregnant women should receive good care, including at least four antenatal visits with a health worker.Mothers at risk of preterm birth (e.g. those who have had a preterm birth before) need to be aware that it may happen again, and plan accordingly.Health workers caring for pregnant women need to assess their risk of delivering preterm and be able to recognize and manage conditions that can lead to preterm birth (e.g. pre-eclampsia, a condition in pregnancy that causes the mother to have high blood pressure).Women in preterm labour should give birth at a health facility where they and their babies can get the care they need. They may need to be referred to a hospital where more advanced care is available, and the safest time to do this is when the baby is still in the womb.Delivery by caesarean section or early induction of labour that is not medically necessary should be avoided.Women in preterm labour, before 34 weeks of pregnancy have been completed, should receive steroid injections to speed up the development of the baby’s lungs.Essential newborn care:All babies need to be protected from infections: everyone who touches the mother or the baby should have clean hands. Medical examinations and procedures should only be done if necessary. Sterile gloves and cutting devices should be used for clamping and cutting the umbilical cord.All babies need to be kept warm: right after birth, they should be dried thoroughly and placed on their mother’s abdomen. If they breathe normally, and after the umbilical cord has been clamped and cut, they should be put on their mother’s chest, with skin-to-skin contact, until after the first breastfeed. They should not be bathed right away.Most babies will breathe normally after thorough drying. Those who do not start breathing on their own need help: ventilation with a bag and mask will usually put them back on track.Breast is best: just like full-term babies, breast milk is the best nutrition for preterm babies. Babies should be breastfed as soon as possible after birth. Most premature babies who are unable to coordinate the suck and swallow reflex can be fed their mother’s expressed breast milk by cup, spoon or nasogastric tube.Extra care for small babies:Preterm babies, and full-term babies with low birth weight need extra warmth and support for feeding.Kangaroo Mother Care is a good way of doing this.Care for preterm babies with complications:Babies who have infections need treatment with antibiotics.Babies who do not breathe when they are born need basic newborn resuscitation; if breathing problems persist, they may need additional support from a machine (ventilator) and extra oxygen.Babies who have additional complications may need to be kept in neonatal intensive care, where that is available."
Q: What is Kangaroo Mother Care?,"Kangaroo Mother Care is a technique by which the baby is held on an adult’s chest—usually the mother—with skin-to-skin contact, for extended periods of time. It is suitable for preterm and full-term babies weighing less than 2kg who do not have other serious problems (breathing well, normal heart rate). The baby is placed on his/her mother’s chest and stays there, day and night, held in place by a cloth that is wrapped and tied at the mother’s back. Kangaroo Mother Care could save an estimated 450 000 preterm newborns a year.Kangaroo Mother Care is an effective way to meet a premature baby’s needs for warmth, frequent breastfeeding, protection from infection, stimulation, safety and love. It has also been shown to improve bonding between mothers and babies."
Q: What is neonatal intensive care?,"Hospitals with neonatal intensive care units can provide specialized care for newborn babies with serious health problems. They have special equipment and specially trained doctors and nurses who provide around-the-clock care for preterm babies who need extra support to keep warm, to breathe and to be fed, or who are very sick."
What sort of supplies are in a standard emergency health kit?,"WHO has standardized medicines and medical supplies needed in emergencies to allow swift, efficient and effective response to the need for medicines and medical supplies. This has led to the supply of standard, pre-packed kits that can be kept in readiness to meet priority health needs in emergency.WHO uses standardized medical kits of different profiles. They are primarily intended for affected or displaced populations without medical facilities. They can also be used for initial supply of primary health care facilities where the normal system of provision has broken down.The most common emergency health kits are:Interagency Emergency Health Kit 2011 (IEHK 2011) is designed to provide health centre coverage in natural disasters or complex emergencies when the health system is disrupted. It consists of two different sets of medicines and medical devices, named a basic unit and supplementary unit. IEHK has enough medicines to treat 10 000 patients for 3 months for common diseases.IEHK basic unit contains essential medicines and medical devices (renewables and equipment) sufficient to ensure treatment for 1000 patients for 3 months for common diseases. It can be used by primary health care workers with limited training.IEHK supplementary unitcontains essential medicines and medical devices (renewables and equipment) for 10 000 people for 3 months for common diseases and is to be used by professional health workers.Inter-Agency Diarrheal Disease Kit (IDDK) provides renewable material, equipment and drugs to meet the needs of up to 700 patients with diarrhoea of different severity or cholera (100 severe cases, 400 mild cases and 100 adults and 100 children for Shigella).Emergency trauma Kit A + Kit B provides renewable material and drugs to meet the needs of 100 patients requiring surgical care. Kit B is a complement to Kit A.Surgical supply kit (SSK) designed to cover all requirements for disposables to treat 100 surgical interventions for 10 days, including surgical operations."
Should tetanus immunizations be given to survivors with injuries in emergency situations?,"In emergency situations where there are serious injuries, tetanus immunization has to be taken into consideration.As tetanus is a complication of wounds and injuries, it is essential that injured people receive appropriate surgical and medical care of contaminated open wounds. Open wounds must be considered as contaminated and should not be closed. Debridement and removal of dead tissue and debris is essential, and depending on the size of the wound may necessitate a surgical procedure undertaken in appropriate conditions. Wounds should be dressed with sterile dressings and the patient scheduled for delayed primary closure.Tetanus immunization is usually provided to victims of natural disasters on an as-needed basis for several reasons.Types of tetanus vaccinesTT - Tetanus Toxoid vaccineDTP - Diphtheria, Tetanus and Pertussis vaccineDT - Diphtheria toxoid and Tetanus toxoid vaccineTd - Tetanus toxoid and Diphtheria toxoid vaccine (low dose diphtheria)First, it is not communicable from person-to-person.Second, in many parts of the world, most people have already some protection against tetanus through immunization.In summary, tetanus prevention can be achieved during emergencies through:Careful cleaning of wounds, both deep and superficial, can substantially decrease the risk of tetanus. Protecting cleaned wounds from recontamination with dressings, and/or topical disinfectants also is important.Protective clothing and closed shoes, if available, should be worn by anyone engaged in clearing away or sifting through debris.If possible, TT vaccination should be offered to anyone engaged in debris clean-up and construction. For those who have not received TT in the past, or for whom past vaccination is uncertain, a second dose should be administered 4-8 weeks after the first. The first dose will not provide protection to those who have not previously been vaccinated, but will rather prime the body to produce anti-tetanus immunity with the second dose given at-least 4 weeks later.If feasible, vaccination with TT-containing vaccine should be offered to all internally displaced people who have not received at least 3 previous doses.Because tetanus risk is high in disaster areas, and because the immunization status of most persons will be unknown, it will be worthwhile to provide doses of TT-containing vaccine, even if only one dose can be assured.Tetanus immunoglobulins may be required for managing those with deep wounds.In emergencies where prior tetanus toxoid immunization levels were low, special attention should be given to preventing maternal and neonatal tetanus, by immunizing women of childbearing age and by improving the hygienic conditions under which childbirths take place. Routine immunization of women and children should also be re-established as soon as possible."
How common are headaches?,"Headaches are extremely common. Nearly everyone has a headache 
occasionally. When they occur repeatedly, they are a symptom of a 
headache disorder. The most common headache disorder is tension-type 
headache. In developed countries, tension-type headache affects over one
 third of men and over one half of women. Recent studies suggest the 
same in developing countries. Less well recognized is the toll of 
headache disorders characterized by very frequent headache: up to 1 
adult in 20 has a headache every – or nearly every – day.


		Migraine is also very common affecting at least 1 adult in 
every 7 in the world. It occurs across all continents, but for reasons 
not yet known appears to be somewhat less common in the Far East. It is 
up to 3 times more common in women than men, a pattern seen everywhere. 
This difference is hormonally-driven. Migraine has been better studied 
than other headache disorders. Often starting at puberty, migraine most 
affects those aged between 35 and 45 years but can trouble much younger 
people, including children. Headache disorders are painful and disabling. They can cause 
substantial personal suffering, impaired quality of life and high 
financial cost. Repeated headache attacks – and often the constant fear 
of the next one – can affect family life, social life and employment. 
Despite this, many people – including many health care professionals – 
tend to perceive headache as a minor or trivial complaint. As a result, 
the physical, emotional, social and economic burdens of headaches are 
poorly acknowledged.For the vast majority of people suffering from headache, 
effective treatment requires no expensive equipment, tests or 
specialists. Headache disorders are mostly, and rightly, managed in 
primary health care. The essential components of effective management 
are awareness of the problem, correct diagnosis, avoidance of 
mismanagement, appropriate lifestyle modifications and informed use of 
cost-effective pharmaceutical remedies."
How can I keep my child's ears clean?,"The ear is a self-cleaning organ and does not require any active cleaning. The ear only needs to be cleaned from outside. No object or fluid should be inserted or instilled into the ears, unless prescribed by a health professional."
Why does my child get pain in the ear?,"Pain in the ear can be caused by problems such as:

impacted cerumen (wax) in the ear;
acute infection in the ear canal;
acute infection of the ear drum; or
because of fluid in the middle ear.

In order to identify the problem, your child should be taken for an ear check-up. Ear pain should not be ignored as it can lead to serious problems."
How can I prevent ear infections in my child?,"Most ear infections can be prevented by taking good care of our ears. Some important things to remember are:

do not let dirty water enter the ear;
do not slap a child, especially over the ears, as it can damage the ear drum, thereby encouraging infections;
ensure early diagnosis of ear infections by staying vigilant for problems like pain in the ear, decreased hearing and wetness in the ear; and
educate children about not inserting anything into the ear such as pencils, erasers, hair-pins etc."
Can I use traditional/herbal remedies in the ear?,No! These may irritate the ear canal and the ear drum and cause infection.
When should I take my child to see the doctor regarding ear problems?,"If your child complains of:

pain in the ear;
discharge from the ear;
hearing loss;
improper speech development;
if your child does not understand what you say properly.

Consult a doctor, as soon as possible."
How long can someone be around a loud noise before it becomes hazardous?,"The degree of hearing hazard is related to both: the level of the noise as well as the duration of the exposure. It is better to protect against loud noise as soon as one is exposed to it. Ear protectors, such as well-fitted ear plugs, should be worn before entering a noisy area."
I enjoy listening to loud music through ear/headphones. Will it harm my hearing ability?,"The risk of hearing loss increases as sound is played at high intensity (volume) and for long durations. It has been shown that listening through earphones at 95% of maximum sound volume for 5 minutes (with most devices) continuously will damage hearing. To protect hearing, volume should be minimized and breaks should be taken while listening through ear/headphones."
What are genetically modified (GM) organisms and GM foods?,"Genetically modified organisms (GMOs) can be defined as organisms (i.e. plants, animals or microorganisms) in which the genetic material (DNA) has been altered in a way that does not occur naturally by mating and/or natural recombination. The technology is often called “modern biotechnology” or “gene technology”, sometimes also “recombinant DNA technology” or “genetic engineering”. It allows selected individual genes to be transferred from one organism into another, also between nonrelated species. Foods produced from or using GM organisms are often referred to as GM foods."
Why are GM foods produced?,"GM foods are developed – and marketed – because there is some perceived advantage either to the producer or consumer of these foods. This is meant to translate into a product with a lower price, greater benefit (in terms of durability or nutritional value) or both. Initially GM seed developers wanted their products to be accepted by producers and have concentrated on innovations that bring direct benefit to farmers (and the food industry generally).
One of the objectives for developing plants based on GM organisms is to improve crop protection. The GM crops currently on the market are mainly aimed at an increased level of crop protection through the introduction of resistance against plant diseases caused by insects or viruses or through increased tolerance towards herbicides.
Resistance against insects is achieved by incorporating into the food plant the gene for toxin production from the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt). This toxin is currently used as a conventional insecticide in agriculture and is safe for human consumption. GM crops that inherently produce this toxin have been shown to require lower quantities of insecticides in specific situations, e.g. where pest pressure is high. Virus resistance is achieved through the introduction of a gene from certain viruses which cause disease in plants. Virus resistance makes plants less susceptible to diseases caused by such viruses, resulting in higher crop yields.
Herbicide tolerance is achieved through the introduction of a gene from a bacterium conveying resistance to some herbicides. In situations where weed pressure is high, the use of such crops has resulted in a reduction in the quantity of the herbicides used."
Is the safety of GM foods assessed differently from conventional foods?,"Generally consumers consider that conventional foods (that have an established record of safe consumption over the history) are safe. Whenever novel varieties of organisms for food use are developed using the traditional breeding methods that had existed before the introduction of gene technology, some of the characteristics of organisms may be altered, either in a positive or a negative way. National food authorities may be called upon to examine the safety of such conventional foods obtained from novel varieties of organisms, but this is not always the case.
In contrast, most national authorities consider that specific assessments are necessary for GM foods. Specific systems have been set up for the rigorous evaluation of GM organisms and GM foods relative to both human health and the environment. Similar evaluations are generally not performed for conventional foods. Hence there currently exists a significant difference in the evaluation process prior to marketing for these two groups of food.
The WHO Department of Food Safety and Zoonoses aims at assisting national authorities in the identification of foods that should be subject to risk assessment and to recommend appropriate approaches to safety assessment. Should national authorities decide to conduct safety assessment of GM organisms, WHO recommends the use of Codex Alimentarius guidelines (See the answer to Question 11 below)."
How is a safety assessment of GM food conducted?,"The safety assessment of GM foods generally focuses on: (a) direct health effects (toxicity), (b) potential to provoke allergic reaction (allergenicity); (c) specific components thought to have nutritional or toxic properties; (d) the stability of the inserted gene; (e) nutritional effects associated with genetic modification; and (f) any unintended effects which could result from the gene insertion."
What are the main issues of concern for human health?,"While theoretical discussions have covered a broad range of aspects, the three main issues debated are the potentials to provoke allergic reaction (allergenicity), gene transfer and outcrossing.
Allergenicity
As a matter of principle, the transfer of genes from commonly allergenic organisms to non-allergic organisms is discouraged unless it can be demonstrated that the protein product of the transferred gene is not allergenic. While foods developed using traditional breeding methods are not generally tested for allergenicity, protocols for the testing of GM foods have been evaluated by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and WHO. No allergic effects have been found relative to GM foods currently on the market.
Gene transfer
Gene transfer from GM foods to cells of the body or to bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract would cause concern if the transferred genetic material adversely affects human health. This would be particularly relevant if antibiotic resistance genes, used as markers when creating GMOs, were to be transferred. Although the probability of transfer is low, the use of gene transfer technology that does not involve antibiotic resistance genes is encouraged.
Outcrossing
The migration of genes from GM plants into conventional crops or related species in the wild (referred to as “outcrossing”), as well as the mixing of crops derived from conventional seeds with GM crops, may have an indirect effect on food safety and food security. Cases have been reported where GM crops approved for animal feed or industrial use were detected at low levels in the products intended for human consumption. Several countries have adopted strategies to reduce mixing, including a clear separation of the fields within which GM crops and conventional crops are grown."
How significant is the problem of infections in health care across the world?,"Health care-associated infections occur worldwide and affect 
hundreds of millions of patients both in developed and developing 
countries. Lack of reliable and standardized surveillance data suggests a
 significant underestimation of the real burden of disease.


		The risk of acquiring health care-associated infections is 
universal and can be found every health-care facility and system around 
the world. Health-care workers are often the channel for the spread of 
such infections to other patients in their care. It should also be noted
 that many patients may carry microbes without any obvious signs or 
symptoms of an infection."
Why is hand hygiene still low after all the efforts to promote in recent years?,"In recent years many parts of the world have seen major 
improvements in hand hygiene. However, there is still not enough access 
to clean water, not enough sinks or towels, not enough awareness of the 
central role played by hand hygiene, and not enough investment in a 
multifaceted approach to tackle the abysmally low levels of compliance.Whatever the reasons, even in resource-rich settings, 
compliance can be as low as 0%, with compliance levels most frequently 
well below 40%."
How is a risk assessment for the environment performed?,"Environmental risk assessments cover both the GMO concerned and the potential receiving environment. The assessment process includes evaluation of the characteristics of the GMO and its effect and stability in the environment, combined with ecological characteristics of the environment in which the introduction will take place. The assessment also includes unintended effects which could result from the insertion of the new gene."
What are the issues of concern for the environment?,Issues of concern include: the capability of the GMO to escape and potentially introduce the engineered genes into wild populations; the persistence of the gene after the GMO has been harvested; the susceptibility of non-target organisms (e.g. insects which are not pests) to the gene product; the stability of the gene; the reduction in the spectrum of other plants including loss of biodiversity; and increased use of chemicals in agriculture. The environmental safety aspects of GM crops vary considerably according to local conditions.
Are GM foods safe?,"Different GM organisms include different genes inserted in different ways. This means that individual GM foods and their safety should be assessed on a case-by-case basis and that it is not possible to make general statements on the safety of all GM foods.
GM foods currently available on the international market have passed safety assessments and are not likely to present risks for human health. In addition, no effects on human health have been shown as a result of the consumption of such foods by the general population in the countries where they have been approved. Continuous application of safety assessments based on the Codex Alimentarius principles and, where appropriate, adequate post market monitoring, should form the basis for ensuring the safety of GM foods."
How are GM foods regulated nationally?,"The way governments have regulated GM foods varies. In some countries GM foods are not yet regulated. Countries which have legislation in place focus primarily on assessment of risks for consumer health. Countries which have regulatory provisions for GM foods usually also regulate GMOs in general, taking into account health and environmental risks, as well as control- and trade-related issues (such as potential testing and labelling regimes). In view of the dynamics of the debate on GM foods, legislation is likely to continue to evolve."
What kind of GM foods are on the market internationally?,GM crops available on the international market today have been designed using one of three basic traits: resistance to insect damage; resistance to viral infections; and tolerance towards certain herbicides. GM crops with higher nutrient content (e.g. soybeans increased oleic acid) have been also studied recently.
What happens when GM foods are traded internationally?,"The Codex Alimentarius Commission (Codex) is the joint FAO/WHO intergovernmental body responsible for developing the standards, codes of practice, guidelines and recommendations that constitute the Codex Alimentarius, meaning the international food code. Codex developed principles for the human health risk analysis of GM foods in 2003.


Principles for the risk analysis of foods derived from modern biotechnology


The premise of these principles sets out a premarket assessment, performed on a caseby- case basis and including an evaluation of both direct effects (from the inserted gene) and unintended effects (that may arise as a consequence of insertion of the new gene) Codex also developed three Guidelines:


Guideline for the conduct of food safety assessment of foods derived from recombinant-DNA plants


Guideline for the conduct of food safety assessment of foods produced using recombinant-DNA microorganisms


Guideline for the conduct of food safety assessment of foods derived from recombinant-DNA animals


Codex principles do not have a binding effect on national legislation, but are referred to specifically in the Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures of the World Trade Organization (SPS Agreement), and WTO Members are encouraged to harmonize national standards with Codex standards. If trading partners have the same or similar mechanisms for the safety assessment of GM foods, the possibility that one product is approved in one country but rejected in another becomes smaller.
The Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety, an environmental treaty legally binding for its Parties which took effect in 2003, regulates transboundary movements of Living Modified Organisms (LMOs). GM foods are within the scope of the Protocol only if they contain LMOs that are capable of transferring or replicating genetic material. The cornerstone of the Protocol is a requirement that exporters seek consent from importers before the first shipment of LMOs intended for release into the environment."
Have GM products on the international market passed a safety assessment?,"The GM products that are currently on the international market have all passed safety assessments conducted by national authorities. These different assessments in general follow the same basic principles, including an assessment of environmental and human health risk. The food safety assessment is usually based on Codex documents."
"Why has there been concern about GM foods among some politicians, public interest groups and consumers?","Since the first introduction on the market in the mid-1990s of a major GM food (herbicide-resistant soybeans), there has been concern about such food among politicians, activists and consumers, especially in Europe. Several factors are involved. In the late 1980s – early 1990s, the results of decades of molecular research reached the public domain. Until that time, consumers were generally not very aware of the potential of this research. In the case of food, consumers started to wonder about safety because they perceive that modern biotechnology is leading to the creation of new species.
Consumers frequently ask, “what is in it for me?”. Where medicines are concerned, many consumers more readily accept biotechnology as beneficial for their health (e.g. vaccines, medicines with improved treatment potential or increased safety). In the case of the first GM foods introduced onto the European market, the products were of no apparent direct benefit to consumers (not significantly cheaper, no increased shelflife, no better taste). The potential for GM seeds to result in bigger yields per cultivated area should lead to lower prices. However, public attention has focused on the risk side of the risk-benefit equation, often without distinguishing between potential environmental impacts and public health effects of GMOs.
Consumer confidence in the safety of food supplies in Europe has decreased significantly as a result of a number of food scares that took place in the second half of the 1990s that are unrelated to GM foods. This has also had an impact on discussions about the acceptability of GM foods. Consumers have questioned the validity of risk assessments, both with regard to consumer health and environmental risks, focusing in particular on long-term effects. Other topics debated by consumer organizations have included allergenicity and antimicrobial resistance. Consumer concerns have triggered a discussion on the desirability of labelling GM foods, allowing for an informed choice of consumers."
What is the state of public debate on GMOs?,"The release of GMOs into the environment and the marketing of GM foods have resulted in a public debate in many parts of the world. This debate is likely to continue, probably in the broader context of other uses of biotechnology (e.g. in human medicine) and their consequences for human societies. Even though the issues under debate are usually very similar (costs and benefits, safety issues), the outcome of the debate differs from country to country. On issues such as labelling and traceability of GM foods as a way to address consumer preferences, there is no worldwide consensus to date. Despite the lack of consensus on these topics, the Codex Alimentarius Commission has made significant progress and developed Codex texts relevant to labelling of foods derived from modern biotechnology in 2011 to ensure consistency on any approach on labelling implemented by Codex members with already adopted Codex provisions."
Are people’s reactions related to the different attitudes to food in various regions of the world?,"Depending on the region of the world, people often have different attitudes to food. In addition to nutritional value, food often has societal and historical connotations, and in some instances may have religious importance. Technological modification of food and food production may evoke a negative response among consumers, especially in the absence of sound risk communication on risk assessment efforts and cost/benefit evaluations."
Are there implications for the rights of farmers to own their crops?,"Yes, intellectual property rights are likely to be an element in the debate on GM foods, with an impact on the rights of farmers. In the FAO/WHO expert consultation in 2003, WHO and FAO have considered potential problems of the technological divide and the unbalanced distribution of benefits and risks between developed and developing countries and the problem often becomes even more acute through the existence of intellectual property rights and patenting that places an advantage on the strongholds of scientific and technological expertise. Such considerations are likely to also affect the debate on GM foods."
Why are certain groups concerned about the growing influence of the chemical industry on agriculture?,"Certain groups are concerned about what they consider to be an undesirable level of control of seed markets by a few chemical companies. Sustainable agriculture and biodiversity benefit most from the use of a rich variety of crops, both in terms of good crop protection practices as well as from the perspective of society at large and the values attached to food. These groups fear that as a result of the interest of the chemical industry in seed markets, the range of varieties used by farmers may be reduced mainly to GM crops. This would impact on the food basket of a society as well as in the long run on crop protection (for example, with the development of resistance against insect pests and tolerance of certain herbicides). The exclusive use of herbicide-tolerant GM crops would also make the farmer dependent on these chemicals. These groups fear a dominant position of the chemical industry in agricultural development, a trend which they do not consider to be sustainable."
What further developments can be expected in the area of GMOs?,"Future GM organisms are likely to include plants with improved resistance against plant disease or drought, crops with increased nutrient levels, fish species with enhanced growth characteristics. For non-food use, they may include plants or animals producing pharmaceutically important proteins such as new vaccines."
What has WHO been doing to improve the evaluation of GM foods?,"WHO has been taking an active role in relation to GM foods, primarily for two reasons:


on the grounds that public health could benefit from the potential of biotechnology, for example, from an increase in the nutrient content of foods, decreased allergenicity and more efficient and/or sustainable food production; and


based on the need to examine the potential negative effects on human health of the consumption of food produced through genetic modification in order to protect public health. Modern technologies should be thoroughly evaluated if they are to constitute a true improvement in the way food is produced.


WHO, together with FAO, has convened several expert consultations on the evaluation of GM foods and provided technical advice for the Codex Alimentarius Commission which was fed into the Codex Guidelines on safety assessment of GM foods. WHO will keep paying due attention to the safety of GM foods from the view of public health protection, in close collaboration with FAO and other international bodies."
Is harmful use of alcohol a public health problem?,"Yes, the harmful use of alcohol is an important public health problem. It impacts people and societies in many ways. 
		It is well known that there is a causal relationship  between 
alcohol consumption and a range of mental and behavioural disorders, 
including alcohol dependence, other noncommunicable conditions such as 
liver diseases, some cancers, cardiovascular diseases, as well as  
injuries resulting from violence and road accidents. Furthermore, there 
are causal relationships between harmful use of alcohol and incidence of
 infectious diseases such as tuberculosis and pneumonia, as well as the 
course of HIV/AIDS. More than this, harmful use of alcohol creates 
considerable negative health and social consequences for people other 
than the drinker.

Current estimates of alcohol-related diseases only partly 
reveal the impact of harmful alcohol use. Accumulating evidence suggests
 a link between harmful use of alcohol and such infectious diseases as 
HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis. Such relationships have to be proven and 
quantified before global burden of disease estimates attributable to 
alcohol can be adjusted accordingly. Harmful use of alcohol is a causal factor in more than 200 
diseases and injuries. In 2012, 5.1% of the global disease burden was 
due to the harmful use of alcohol, and an estimated 3.3 million people 
died  from alcohol related conditions that year.  
Beyond health consequences, the harmful use of alcohol brings 
significant social and economic losses to individuals and society at 
large. In countries with lower economic wealth the morbidity and 
mortality risks are higher per litre of pure alcohol consumed than in 
the higher income countries."
What are the main differences between rich and poor countries with respect to causes of death?,"In high-income countries, 7 in every 10 deaths are among people
 aged 70 years and older. People predominantly die of chronic diseases: 
cardiovascular diseases, cancers, dementia, chronic obstructive lung 
disease or diabetes. Lower respiratory infections remain the only 
leading infectious cause of death. Only 1 in every 100 deaths is among 
children under 15 years.
		In middle-income countries, chronic diseases are the major 
killers, just as they are in high-income countries. Unlike in 
high-income countries, however, diarrhoeal diseases, road injury, 
HIV/AIDS and  prematurity also are leading causes of death. In low-income countries, nearly 4 in every 10 deaths are among
 children under 15 years, and only 2 in every 10 deaths are among people
 aged 70 years and older. People predominantly die of infectious 
diseases: lower respiratory infections, HIV/AIDS, diarrhoeal diseases, 
malaria and tuberculosis collectively account for almost one third of 
all deaths in these countries. Complications of childbirth due to 
prematurity, and birth asphyxia and birth trauma are among the leading 
causes of death among children under 5 years old, claiming the lives of 
many newborns and infants. Related linksSummary of World health statistics 2014"
"What are the key health dangers for children, and what is WHO doing to address them?","Nearly 6.9 million children under the age of five died in 2011 – nearly 800 every hour – but most could survive threats and thrive with access to simple, affordable interventions.The risk of death is highest in the first month of life. Preterm birth, birth asphyxia and infections cause most newborn deaths. Health risks to newborns are minimized by:quality care during pregnancy;safe delivery by a skilled birth attendant; andstrong neonatal care: immediate attention to breathing and warmth, hygienic cord and skin care, and early initiation of exclusive breastfeeding.From one month to five years of age, the main causes of death are pneumonia, diarrhoea, malaria and measles. Malnutrition is estimated to contribute to more than one third of all child deaths.Pneumonia is the prime cause of death in children under five years of age. Addressing the major risk factors – including malnutrition and indoor air pollution – is essential to preventing pneumonia, as are vaccination and breastfeeding. Antibiotics and oxygen are vital tools for effectively managing the illness.Diarrhoeal diseases are a leading cause of sickness and death among children in developing countries. Breastfeeding helps prevent diarrhoea among young children. Treatment for sick children with Oral Rehydration Salts (ORS) combined with zinc supplements is safe, cost-effective, and saves lives.One child dies every minute from malaria. Insecticide-treated nets prevent transmission and increase child survival.Over 90% of children with HIV are infected through mother-to-child transmission; this can be prevented with antiretrovirals, as well as safer delivery and feeding practices.Worldwide, about 20% of deaths among children under-five could be avoided if feeding guidelines are followed. WHO recommends exclusive breastfeeding for six months, introducing age-appropriate and safe complementary foods at six months, and continuing breastfeeding for up to two years or beyond.About two-thirds of child deaths are preventable through practical, low-cost interventions. WHO is improving child health by helping countries to deliver integrated, effective care in a continuum - starting with a healthy pregnancy for the mother, through birth and care up to five years of age. Investing in strong health systems is key to prevention and delivery of quality care.Related linksHealth topic: child healthFact sheet on child mortalityMaternal, newborn, child and adolescent healthPartnership for Maternal, Newborn and Child Health"
"Know the IHR; purpose, scope, principles and concepts","The International Health Regulations (2005) (hereinafter ""the IHR"" or “the Regulations”) are an international agreement that is legally binding on 194 countries (States Parties), including all WHO Member States. The IHR define their ""purpose and scope"" as: ""to prevent, protect against, control and provide a public health response to the international spread of disease in ways that are commensurate with and restricted to public health risks, and which avoid unnecessary interference with international traffic and trade"". Since their entry into force on 15 June 2007, the IHR directs and governs particular WHO and States Parties activities aiming that protect the global community from public health risks and emergencies that cross international borders.These activities are implemented in ways that are consistent with other international law and agreements; their implementation must ""be with full respect for the dignity, human rights and fundamental freedom of persons"" and ""guided by the goal of their universal application for the protection of all people of the world from the international spread of disease"".The scope of the IHR is purposely broad and inclusive in respect of the public health event to which they have application in order to maximize the probability that all such events that could have serious international consequences are identified early and promptly reported by States Parties to WHO for assessment. The Regulations aim to provide a legal frame work for the prevention, detection and containment of public health risks at source, before they spread across borders, through the collaborative actions of States Parties and WHO.Notification is required under IHR for all ""events that may constitute a public health emergency of international concern"". In this regard, the broad new definitions of ""event"", ""disease"" and ""public health risk"" in the IHR are the building blocks of the surveillance obligations for States Parties and WHO. ""Disease"" means ""an illness or medical condition, irrespective of origin or source, that presents or could present significant harm to humans"". The term ""event"" is broadly defined as ""a manifestation of disease or an occurrence that creates a potential for disease"". ""Public health risk"" refers to ""a likelihood of an event that may affect adversely the health of human populations, with an emphasis on one which may spread internationally or may present a serious and direct danger"". A public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) is defined as ""an extraordinary event which is determined to constitute a public health risk to other States through the international spread of disease and to potentially require a coordinated international response"". Consequently, events of potential international concern, which require States Parties to notify WHO, can extend beyond communicable diseases and arise from any origin or source.The IHR explicitly allow WHO to take into account information from sources other than official notifications and consultations, and, after assessment, to seek verification of specific events from the concerned States Parties. Notification to WHO marks the beginning of an exclusive dialogue between the notifying State Party and WHO on further event assessment, potential investigation and any appropriate local or global public health response.The responsibility for implementing the IHR rests jointly with States Parties and WHO. In order to be able to notify events, or respond to public health risks and emergencies, States Parties must have the capacity to detect such events through a well established national surveillance and response infrastructure. States Parties are required to collaborate actively with each other, together with WHO, to mobilize the financial resources to facilitate the implementation of their obligations under the IHR. Upon request, WHO assists developing countries in mobilizing financial resources and provides technical support to build, strengthen and maintain the capacities set out in Annex 1 of the Regulations."
Update national legislation,"An adequate legal framework to support and enable all of the varied IHR State Party activities is needed in each country. In some countries, giving effect to the IHR within domestic jurisdiction and national law requires that the relevant authorities adopt implementing legislation for some or all of the relevant rights and obligations for States Parties. However, even where new or revised legislation may not be explicitly required under a country's legal system for implementation of one or more provisions in the IHR, revision of some legislation, regulations or other instruments may still be considered by the country in order to facilitate performance of IHR activities in a more efficient, effective or otherwise beneficial manner. Additionally, from a policy perspective, implementing legislation may serve to institutionalize and strengthen the role of IHR capacities and operations within the State Party, as well as the ability to exercise certain rights contained in the Regulations. A further potential benefit from such legislation is that it can facilitate necessary coordination among the different entities involved in implementation and help to ensure continuity. For these reasons, States Parties to the IHR should consider assessing their relevant existing legislation to determine whether they may be appropriate for revision in order to facilitate full and efficient implementation of the Regulations."
Recognize shared realities and the need for collective defences,"The recognition that globalisation brings with it new challenges and opportunities for preventing the international spread of disease was the starting point for the revision of the International Health Regulations (1969) or ""IHR (1969)"". In 2003, the outbreak and eventual control of SARS convinced the world's governments of the necessity for a collective and coordinated defence against emerging public health threats, providing the impetus needed to complete the revision process. The IHR were adopted by the Health Assembly on 23 May 2005, and entered into force on 15 June 2007.The IHR legal framework supports existing and innovative approaches in the global detection of events and response to public health risks and emergencies. The current Regulations were built in part on the foundations of their predecessor, the IHR (1969), and were primarily based on the experiences of WHO and its Member States in national surveillance systems, epidemic intelligence, verification, risk assessment, outbreak alert, and coordination of international response, all of which are part of WHO’s decade-long work to enhance global public health security.In contrast to the IHR (1969), the current Regulations have a broad scope, provide for the use of a wide range of information and emphasize collaborative actions between States Parties and WHO in the identification and assessment of events and response to public health risks and emergencies. In WHO's coordination of the international response to public health emergencies of international concern, maximum measures are replaced by formally recommended and context-specific temporary health measures, tailored to the actual threat faced."
Monitor and report on IHR implementation progress,"States Parties and WHO alike are required to report to the World Health Assembly on IHR implementation. To date, this requirement has been fulfilled through annual reporting by the WHO Secretariat to its governing bodies. Using information gathered through questionnaires, the WHO Secretariat has summarized the activities carried by countries to implement the IHR. It is anticipated that, in the future, this data will be collected using specific indicators currently under development. In addition to this, the IHR Coordination Department collaborates closely with WHO Regional Offices and other relevant departments and programmes to report on WHO’s work in support of IHR implementation."
"Notify, report, consult and inform WHO","The IHR describe key elements of the procedures to be followed by States Parties and WHO in terms of information sharing with regard to notified events. Official event-related communications under the IHR are carried out between the National IHR Focal Point and their corresponding regional WHO IHR Contact Point, both of whom are officially designated and required to be available on a 24 hour basis, 7 days a week.The IHR (2005) specify three ways in which States Parties can initiate event-related communications with WHO:Notification – Under the IHR, States Parties are required to notify WHO of all events that are assessed as possibly constituting a PHEIC, taking into account the context in which an event occurs. These notifications must occur within 24 hours of assessment by the country using the decision instrument provided in Annex 2 of the Regulations. This decision instrument identifies four criteria that States Parties must follow in their assessment of events within their territories and their decision as to whether an event is notifiable to WHO:Is the public health impact of the event serious?Is the event unusual or unexpected?Is there a significant risk of international spread?Is there a significant risk of international restriction(s) to travel and trade?Notifications must be followed by ongoing communication of detailed public health information on the event, including, where possible, case definition, laboratory results, source and type of the risk, number of cases and deaths, conditions affecting the spread of the disease and the health measures employed.Consultation - In cases where the State Party is unable to complete a definitive assessment with the decision instrument in Annex 2, State Parties have an explicit option of initiating confidential consultations with WHO and seeking advice on evaluation, assessment and appropriate health measures to be taken.Other Reports - State Parties must inform WHO through the National IHR Focal Point within 24 hours of receipt of evidence of a public health risk identified outside their territory that may cause international disease spread, as manifested by imported or exported human cases, vectors which carry infection or contamination, or by contaminated goods.In addition to these three types of communications, States Parties are required under the IHR to respond to WHO Requests for Verification. WHO has an express mandate to obtain verification from States Parties concerning unofficial reports or communications, received from various sources, about events arising within their territories which may constitute a PHEIC; these reports are initially reviewed by WHO prior to the issuing of a verification request. States Parties must acknowledge verification requests by WHO within 24 hours and provide public health information on the status of the event, followed, in a timely manner, by continued communication of accurate and sufficiently detailed public health information available to the notifying State Party."
"Understand WHO’s role in international event detection, joint assessment and response","The IHR underpin WHO’s mandate to manage the international response to acute public health events and risks, including public health emergencies of international concern. The Regulations also recognize WHO's general surveillance obligations, and set out specific procedures for concerned States Parties and WHO to collaborate in the assessment and control of public health events and risks, even before such events have been officially notified to WHO.At the international level, WHO’s real-time analysis of public health events uses technical knowledge, an understanding of the situational and operational context, and risk communication requirements to assess public health risks in accordance with WHO’s mandate under the IHR. To further strengthen international alert and response capabilities, an enhanced event-management system and standard operating procedures have been developed by WHO. This web-based tool functions as the official repository of all information relevant to an event that may constitute a public health emergency of international concern. It facilitates communications within WHO, with National IHR Focal Points, with technical institutions and partners, and provides timely public health information for the management of these events and risks.Information relating to public health risks notified or reported under the IHR (2005) to WHO is jointly assessed with the affected State Party to ascertain the nature and extent of the risk, the potential for international disease spread and interference with travel and trade, and appropriate response and containment strategies.In order to meet its IHR obligations and to facilitate information sharing between the Organization and States Parties to the Regulations, WHO has established an IHR Event Information Site. This site is accessible to National IHR Focal Points and provides up-to-date information on ongoing public health events of international concern."
Participate in the PHEIC determination and WHO recommendations-making processes,"PHEIC determinations and the issuing of corresponding WHO recommendations by the Director-General will be a rare occurrence. Indeed, since the entry into force of the IHR on 15 June 2007 only one such determination has been made and recommendations issued. It is important that States Parties to the IHR are aware of the processes that may affect them and of their right to be consulted and present their views.If immediate global action is needed to provide a public health response to prevent or control the international spread of disease, the IHR give the Director-General of WHO the authority to determine that the event constitutes a PHEIC. On such occasions, an IHR Emergency Committee provides its views to the Director-General on temporary recommendations on the most appropriate and necessary public health measures to respond to the emergency. A State Party affected by a potential emergency needs to work closely with WHO to ensure that all relevant information and considerations are brought to bear prior such a determination and the adoption of any corresponding temporary recommendations. However, the right of a State to be consulted or prevent its views to an Emergency Committee shall be without prejudice to the need to act swiftly in the event of an emergency.In cases where the State Party concerned may not agree that a PHEIC is occurring, the Emergency Committee will also provide advice. The temporary recommendations issued by the Director-General are for affected and non-affected States Parties in order to prevent or reduce the international spread of disease and avoid unnecessary interference with international traffic."
Strengthen national surveillance and response capacities,"Another fundamental aspect of the IHR is the obligation for all States Parties to develop, strengthen and maintain core public health capacities for surveillance and response. In order to be able to detect, assess, notify and report events and respond to public health risks and emergencies of international concern, States Parties must meet the requirements described in Annex 1A of the IHR (2005). Annex 1A outlines these core capacities at the local (community), intermediate and national levels, including, at the national level, the assessment of all reports of urgent events within 48 hours and the immediate reporting to WHO through the National IHR Focal Point, when required.The IHR require each State Party, with the support of WHO, to meet the core surveillance and response capacity requirements ""as soon as possible"", but not later than five years after the date of entry into force for that country. The IHR set out a two-phase process to assist States Parties to plan for the implementation of their public health capacity obligations. In the first phase, from 15 June 2007 to 15 June 2009, States Parties must assess the ability of their existing national structures and resources to meet the core surveillance and response capacity requirements. This assessment must lead to the development and implementation of national plans of action. As specified in the IHR, WHO must support these assessments and provide guidance on the national planning and implementation of these capacity strengthening plans.In the second phase from 15 June 2009 to 15 June 2012, the national action plans are expected to be implemented by each State Party to ensure that core capacities are present and functioning throughout the country and/or its relevant territories. States Parties that experience difficulties in implementing their plans may request an additional two year period until 15 June 2014 to meet their Annex 1A obligations. On the basis of a justified need, an extension of two years may be obtained. In exceptional circumstances, and supported by a new implementation plan, the Director-General of WHO may grant an individual State Party a further extension not exceeding two years to meet its obligations."
Increase public health security at ports airports and ground crossings,"International points of entry, whether by land, sea or air, provide an opportunity to apply health measures to prevent international spread of disease. For this reason, many of the provisions addressing this aspect in the IHR (1969) have been updated in the IHR (2005). A number of new provisions have been included. When applying IHR-related health measures to international travellers, for example, it is required that they be treated with courtesy and respect, taking into consideration their gender, sociocultural, ethnic and religious concerns. They must be supplied with appropriate food, water, accommodation and medical treatment if quarantined, isolated or otherwise subject to medical or public health measures under the IHR (2005).States Parties are required to designate the international airports and ports and any ground crossings which will develop specific capacities in the application of the public health measures required to manage a variety of public health risks. These capacities include access to appropriate medical services (with diagnostic facilities), services for the transport of ill persons, trained personnel to inspect ships, aircraft and other conveyances, maintenance of a healthy environment as well as ensuring plans and facilities to apply emergency measures such as quarantine."
Use and disseminate IHR health documents at points of entry,"The IHR require the implementation of a range of health documents at ports, airports and ground crossings. Failure by States Parties to use and include these documents in their daily operations may result in unnecessary disruption to international traffic.Model Ship Sanitation Control Exemption Certificate/Ship Sanitation Control CertificateThe Ship Sanitation Control Exemption Certificate/Ship Sanitation Control Certificate replaced the narrower in scope Deratting/Deratting Exemption Certificate on 15 June 2007.Model Maritime Declaration of HealthThe Maritime Declaration of Health reflects the broader scope of the IHR and currently accepted technical standards and terminology.Model International Certificate of Vaccination or Prophylaxis replaces the International Certificate of Vaccination or Revaccination against Yellow FeverYellow fever is the only disease specifically designated under the IHR for which proof of vaccination or prophylaxis may be required for travellers as a condition of entry to a State. The “International certificate of vaccination or revaccination against yellow fever” was replaced by the “International certificate of vaccination or prophylaxis” (ICVP). Clinicians issuing the certificate should note that the main difference from the old certificate is that they have to specify in writing in the space provided that the disease for which the certificate is issued is “yellow fever”. The ICVP does not contain a references to a designated vaccination centre.Health Part of the Aircraft General DeclarationThis is a document of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), a United Nations agency. The document is periodically reviewed by ICAO Member States, and has historically, for practical purposes, been reproduced in the annexes of the IHR. Consequently, the July 2007 revision of the Declaration adopted by ICAO has been reproduced in the 2008 second edition of the IHR (2005)."
What are the main sources of household air pollution in developing countries?,"Nearly 3 billion of the world’s poorest still rely on solid fuels 
(wood, animal dung, charcoal, crop wastes and coal) burned in 
inefficient and highly polluting stoves for cooking and heating. The 
resulting household air pollution led to more than 4 million premature 
deaths among children and adults in 2012."
What are the health consequences?,"Of the 4.3 million people who die annually from exposure to 
household air pollutants, most perish from stroke (34%), ischaemic heart
 disease (26%) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (22%). 
Pneumonia and lung cancer account for 12% and 6% of deaths, 
respectively. Women and young children, who spend the most time near the 
domestic hearth, are particularly vulnerable. More than 50% of pneumonia
 deaths among children under 5 are linked to household air pollution."
"Are there other consequences for development, beyond human health?","Polluting household fuels also endanger the health of the 
planet. Emissions of black carbon and methane from low-efficiency stoves
 contribute to outdoor air pollution and increase the rate of climate 
change.In many regions, fuel gathering for traditional stoves 
consumes considerable time for women and children, limiting other 
productive activities—such as generating income—and taking children away
 from school. Safe and efficient cooking stoves would reduce the 
workload for women and children and decrease the demand on scarce 
natural resources (eg. forests)."
What are simple action steps for sun protection?,"Shade, sunglasses, clothing and hats provide the best 
protection – applying sunscreen becomes necessary on those parts of the 
body that remain exposed, like the face and hands. Sunscreen should 
never be used to prolong the duration of sun exposure.
Limit time in the midday sun. The sun’s UV rays are the strongest
 between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. Take particular care when in the sun during 
these hours.  Watch for the UV index. This important resource helps you plan 
your outdoor activities in ways that prevent overexposure to the sun’s 
rays. When the UV Index is moderate, i.e. a UVI of 3 or above, sun 
protection is required. 
Use shade wisely. Seek shade when UV rays are the most intense, 
but keep in mind that shade structures such as trees, umbrellas or 
canopies do not offer complete sun protection. Wear protective clothing. A hat with a wide brim offers good sun 
protection for your eyes, ears, face, and the back or your neck. 
Sunglasses that provide 99 to 100 percent UV-A and UV-B protection will 
greatly reduce eye damage from sun exposure. Tightly woven, loose 
fitting clothes that covers as much of the body as possible will provide
 additional protection from the sun. Use sunscreen. Apply a broad-spectrum sunscreen of SPF 30+ 
liberally to exposed skin and re-apply every two hours, or after 
working, swimming, playing or exercising outdoors.  Avoid sunlamps and tanning parlours. Sunbeds and sunlamps 
increase the risk of skin cancer and can damage unprotected eyes. They 
should be avoided entirely. Protect children. Children are generally more susceptible to 
environmental hazards than adults. During outdoor activities, they 
should be protected from high UV exposure as above, and babies should 
always remain in the shade."
How can I connect with other HTA groups?,International cooperation and information exchange is very well established in the HTA community of practice and there are many international and regional networks worldwide.

What is the difference between Health Impact Assessment and Health Technology Assessment?,"Health Impact Assessment is a means of assessing the health impacts of policies, plans and projects in diverse economic sectors using quantitative, qualitative and participatory techniques. HIA helps decision-makers make choices about alternatives and improvements to prevent disease/injury and to actively promote health. Whereas Health Technology Assessment is systematic evaluation of properties, effects, and/or impacts of health technology and interventions. It is a multidisciplinary process to evaluate the clinical, social, economic, organizational and ethical issues of a health intervention or health technology. The main purpose of conducting an assessment is to inform a policy decision-making, especially on how best to allocate limited funds to health interventions and technologies."
Where can I find some examples of HTA reports?,Most HTA organizations publish an executive summary or the full version of their HTA reports on their website. The Center for Reviews and Dissemination at the University of York has developed an extensive database of completed and ongoing health technology assessments from around the world.The database access
How can the human rights of people with mental health conditions be promoted and protected?,"People with mental health conditions around the world are 
exposed to a wide range of human rights violations. The stigma they face
 means they are often ostracized from society and fail to receive the 
care they require or the services and support they need to lead full 
lives in the community. In some communities, people with mental health 
conditions are banished to the edge of town where they are left 
semi-naked or in rags, tied up, beaten and left to go hungry. 
		People in many mental hospitals fair little better. People 
are restrained with metal shackles, confined in caged beds, deprived of 
clothing, decent bedding, clean water or proper toilet facilities and 
are subject to abuse and neglect. People with mental health conditions also face discrimination 
on a daily basis including in the fields of education, employment and 
housing. Some countries even prohibit people from voting, marrying or 
having children. How can these violations be prevented?Ratify the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD).
 The coming into force of the Convention is  a major milestone in 
efforts to promote, protect and ensure the full and equal enjoyment of 
all human rights of people with disabilities.  Countries should align 
their policies and laws to the Convention, ensuring that these promote 
autonomy, liberty, legal capacity, participation of people with mental 
health conditions, as well as the range of services required for 
independent community living. 
Change attitudes and raise awareness. Ministries of 
Health, organizations of people with mental health conditions, health 
professionals, NGOs including Disabled Peoples’ Organizations academic 
institutions, professional organizations and other stakeholders should 
unify their efforts in educating and changing public attitudes towards 
mental illness and in advocating for the rights of people with mental 
disorders.
Improve human rights in mental health facilities. Ways to 
assess quality of care and human rights conditions should be established
 to protect against inhuman and degrading treatment, poor living 
conditions and involuntary admission and treatment. People should be 
able to file complaints in cases of human rights violations.
Empower people with mental health conditions and their families.
 Governments should support creating and/or strengthening of 
organizations of people with mental health conditions and as well as 
family organizations. Such groups are in the best position to highlight 
problems, specify their needs, and help find solutions to prevent 
violations and improving mental health and other required services in 
countries. They have a crucial role to play in the design and 
implementation of policies, plans, laws and services.
Replace psychiatric institutions with community care. 
Large institutions, which are so often associated with human rights 
violations, should be replaced by community mental health care services,
 backed by psychiatric beds in general hospital and home care support. 
Mental health services need to link to services and supports in the 
community, enabling people with mental health conditions to enjoy 
educational, employment, social service and housing opportunities on an 
equal basis with others.
Increase investment in mental health. Governments need to 
dedicate more of their health budget to mental health. In addition the 
mental health workforce at each level of the health care system needs to
 be developed and trained to ensure that all people have access to good 
quality mental health services that promote recovery and respect for 
human rights.  
The WHO QualityRights project aims to help countries to 
achieve these goals.  The project supports governments to assess and 
improve quality and human rights conditions in mental health services. 
It alsobuilds capacity on human rights and recovery, empower people with
 mental health conditions through the strengthening of Disabled People’s
 Organizations, and  reform national policies and legislation in line 
with international human rights standards."
"Why can’t we give water to a breastfeeding baby before the 6 months, even when it is hot?","Giving water to young babies puts them at risk of diarrhoea and
 malnutrition. Water may not be clean and cause the baby to have 
infections. Giving water may also cause the baby to drink less 
breastmilk or to stop breastfeeding early and therefore cause 
malnutrition. If mothers give water instead of breastfeeding it will 
also cause the mother to have less milk in the future. 
		Breast milk is more than 80% water, especially the first milk 
that comes with each feed. Therefore, whenever the mother feels her baby
 is thirsty she can breastfeed him or her. This will satisfy the bay’s 
thirst, and continue to protect the baby from infections, and help the 
baby to continue to grow well. Babies do not need water before they are 6
 months old, even in a hot climate. This is one of the reasons that WHO 
recommends for children to be exclusively breastfed for the first 6 
months of life.A child is considered exclusively breastfed when he or she 
receives only breast milk, without any additional food or liquid, even 
water, with the exception of oral rehydration solution, drops, syrups of
 vitamins, minerals or medicines.  When breastfeeding, the mother gives 
her baby all the water he or she needs, while providing “safe water” and
 protecting the baby against diarrhoea."
Why are so many children involved in road traffic crashes?,"Children are at risk for road traffic injuries for a number of 
reasons. Younger children are limited by their physical, cognitive and 
social development, making them more vulnerable in road traffic than 
adults. Because of their small stature, it can be difficult for children
 to see surrounding traffic and for drivers and others to see them. In 
addition if they are involved in a road traffic crash, their softer 
heads make them more susceptible to serious head injury than adults. 
		Younger children may have difficulties interpreting various 
sights and sounds, which may impact on their judgement regarding the 
proximity, speed and direction of moving vehicles. Younger children may 
also be impulsive, and their short attention spans mean that they 
struggle to cope with more than one challenge at a time. As they grow 
older, children of adolescent age are especially prone to take risks, 
compromising their safety on the road. In general roads are planned 
without sufficient consideration of the specific needs of children. Globally, around 186 300 children under 18 years die from road
 traffic crashes annually, and road traffic injuries are the leading 
killer of children aged 15-17 years worldwide. Two times as many boys as
 girls die in road traffic crashes. In addition, rates of road traffic 
death among children are 3 times higher in low- and middle-income 
countries than in high-income countries. Road traffic injuries can be prevented. While no single 
measure adequately addresses the vast range of risks to children on the 
road, the ten strategies below are those which are best known - 
especially when implemented as a package - to keep children safe on the 
road. Controlling speedReducing drinking and drivingUsing helmets for bicyclists and motorcyclistsRestraining children in vehiclesImproving children's ability to see and be seenEnhancing road infrastructureAdapting vehicle designImplementing graduated driver licensingThese are discussed in detail in a new document called ""Ten strategies for keeping children safe on the road” published by WHO on the occasion of the Third United Nations Global Road Safety Week (4–10 May 2015).

What is hepatitis B?,"Hepatitis B is a liver disease caused by the hepatitis B virus 
(HBV). The virus interferes with the functions of the liver and causes 
pathological damage. A small percentage of infected people cannot get 
rid of the virus and become chronically infected – these people are at 
higher risk of death from cirrhosis of the liver and liver cancer."
How do you get hepatitis B?,"HBV is spread by contact with blood or body fluids of an 
infected person – the same way as the human immunodeficiency virus 
(HIV). However, HBV is 50 to 100 times more infectious than HIV.The main ways of getting infected with HBV are:from mother to baby at the birth (perinatal)from child-to-child unsafe injections and transfusionsunprotected sexual contact.Worldwide, most infections occur from mother-to-child, from 
child-to-child (especially in household settings), and from reuse of 
unsterilized needles and syringes. Before the widespread use of the 
hepatitis B vaccine, almost all children in developing countries used to
 become infected with the virus."
How is Hepatitis B NOT spread?,"Hepatitis B virus is NOT spread by sharing eating utensils, 
breastfeeding, hugging, kissing, holding hands, coughing, sneezing or by
 recreational use of public pools or the like."
How can I protect myself?,"You can protect yourself against hepatitis B by being vaccinated. 
The hepatitis B vaccine has an outstanding record of safety and 
effectiveness, and since 1982, over 1 billion doses have been used 
worldwide. The vaccine is 95% effective in preventing chronic infections
 from developing. Protection lasts for 20 years at least, no booster is 
recommended by WHO as of today."
Up to what age can a baby stay well nourished by just being breastfed?,"Infants should be exclusively breastfed – i.e. receive only breast milk – for the first six months of life to achieve optimal growth, development and health. ""Exclusive breastfeeding"" is defined as giving no other food or drink – not even water – except breast milk. It does, however, allow the infant to receive oral rehydration salts (ORS), drops and syrups (vitamins, minerals and medicines). Breast milk is the ideal food for the healthy growth and development of infants; breastfeeding is also an integral part of the reproductive process with important implications for the health of mothers.WHO recommends that infants start receiving complementary foods at six months (180 days) of age in addition to breast milk. Foods should be adequate, meaning that they provide sufficient energy, protein and micronutrients to meet a growing child's nutritional needs. Foods should be prepared and given in a safe manner to minimize the risk of contamination. Feeding young infants requires active care and stimulation to encourage the child to eat.The transition from exclusive breastfeeding to full use of family foods is a very vulnerable period. It is the time when many infants become malnourished, contributing significantly to the high prevalence of malnutrition in children under five years of age worldwide. It is essential therefore that infants receive appropriate, adequate and safe complementary foods to ensure the right transition from the breastfeeding period to the full use of family foods.Amounts of foods to offerAgeTextureFrequencyAmount at each meala6–8 monthsStart with thick porridge, well mashed foodsContinue with mashed family foods2–3 meals per day, plus frequent breastfeedsDepending on the child's appetite, 1–2 snacks may be offeredStart with 2–3 tablespoonfuls per feed, increasing gradually to ½ of a 250 ml cup9–11 monthsFinely chopped or mashed foods, and foods that baby can pick up3–4 meals per day, plus breastfeedsDepending on the child's appetite, 1–2 snacks may be offered½ of a 250 ml cup/bowl12–23 monthsFamily foods, chopped or mashed if necessary3–4 meals per day, plus breastfeedsDepending on the child's appetite, 1–2 snacks may be offered¾ to full 250 ml cup/bowl    a Note: If baby is not breastfed, give in addition: 1–2 cups of milk per day, and 1–2 extra meals per day. Related LinksPromoting proper feeding for infants and young childrenGlobal Strategy for Infant and Young Child FeedingThe WHO Child Growth Standards"
What do you consider as red meat?,"Red meat refers to all mammalian muscle meat, including, beef, veal, pork, lamb, mutton, horse, and goat."
What do you consider as processed meat?,"Processed meat refers to meat that has been transformed 
through salting, curing, fermentation, smoking, or other processes to 
enhance flavour or improve preservation. Most processed meats contain 
pork or beef, but processed meats may also contain other red meats, 
poultry, offal, or meat by-products such as blood.Examples of processed meat include hot dogs (frankfurters), 
ham, sausages, corned beef, and biltong or beef jerky as well as canned 
meat and meat-based preparations and sauces."
Why did IARC choose to evaluate red meat and processed meat?,"An international advisory committee that met in 2014 recommended 
red meat and processed meat as high priorities for evaluation by the 
IARC Monographs Programme. This recommendation was based on 
epidemiological studies suggesting that small increases in the risk of 
several cancers may be associated with high consumption of red meat or 
processed meat. Although these risks are small, they could be important 
for public health because many people worldwide eat meat and meat 
consumption is increasing in low- and middle-income countries. Although 
some health agencies already recommend limiting intake of meat, these 
recommendations are aimed mostly at reducing the risk of other diseases.
 With this in mind, it was important for IARC to provide authoritative 
scientific evidence on the cancer risks associated with eating red meat 
and processed meat."
"What are the safest methods of cooking meat (e.g. sautéing, boiling, broiling, or barbecuing)?","Cooking at high temperatures or with the food in direct contact 
with a flame or a hot surface, as in barbecuing or pan-frying, produces 
more of certain types of carcinogenic chemicals (such as polycyclic 
aromatic hydrocarbons and heterocyclic aromatic amines). However, there 
were not enough data for the IARC Working Group to reach a conclusion 
about whether the way meat is cooked affects the risk of cancer."
Is eating raw meat safer?,"There were no data to address this question in relation to cancer 
risk. However, the separate question of risk of infection from 
consumption of raw meat needs to be kept in mind."
"Red meat was classified as Group 2A, probably carcinogenic to humans. What does this mean exactly?","In the case of red meat, the classification is based on 
limited evidence from epidemiological studies showing positive 
associations between eating red meat and developing colorectal cancer as
 well as strong mechanistic evidence.Limited evidence means that a positive association has been 
observed between exposure to the agent and cancer but that other 
explanations for the observations (technically termed chance, bias, or 
confounding) could not be ruled out."
"Processed meat was classified as Group 1, carcinogenic to humans. What does this mean?","This category is used when there is sufficient evidence of 
carcinogenicity in humans. In other words, there is convincing evidence 
that the agent causes cancer. The evaluation is usually based on 
epidemiological studies showing the development of cancer in exposed 
humans.In the case of processed meat, this classification is based on
 sufficient evidence from epidemiological studies that eating processed 
meat causes colorectal cancer."
Processed meat was classified as carcinogenic to humans(Group 1). Tobacco smoking and asbestos are also both classified as carcinogenic to humans(Group 1). Does it mean that consumption of processed meat is as carcinogenic as tobacco smoking and asbestos?,"No, processed meat has been classified in the same category as 
causes of cancer such as tobacco smoking and asbestos (IARC Group 1, 
carcinogenic to humans), but this does NOT mean that they are all 
equally dangerous. The IARC classifications describe the strength of the
 scientific evidence about an agent being a cause of cancer, rather than
 assessing the level of risk."
What types of cancers are linked or associated with eating red meat?,"The strongest, but still limited, evidence for an association with
 eating red meat is for colorectal cancer. There is also evidence of 
links with pancreatic cancer and prostate cancer."
What types of cancers are linked or associated with eating processed meat?,"The IARC Working Group concluded that eating processed meat causes
 colorectal cancer. An association with stomach cancer was also seen, 
but the evidence is not conclusive."
How many cancer cases every year can be attributed to consumption of processed meat and red meat?,"According to the most recent estimates by the Global Burden of
 Disease Project, an independent academic research organization, about 
34 000 cancer deaths per year worldwide are attributable to diets high 
in processed meat.Eating red meat has not yet been established as a cause of 
cancer. However, if the reported associations were proven to be causal, 
the Global Burden of Disease Project has estimated that diets high in 
red meat could be responsible for 50 000 cancer deaths per year 
worldwide.These numbers contrast with about 1 million cancer deaths per 
year globally due to tobacco smoking, 600 000 per year due to alcohol 
consumption, and more than 200 000 per year due to air pollution."
Could you quantify the risk of eating red meat and processed meat?,"The consumption of processed meat was associated with small 
increases in the risk of cancer in the studies reviewed. In those 
studies, the risk generally increased with the amount of meat consumed. 
An analysis of data from 10 studies estimated that every 50 gram portion
 of processed meat eaten daily increases the risk of colorectal cancer 
by about 18%.The cancer risk related to the consumption of red meat is more
 difficult to estimate because the evidence that red meat causes cancer 
is not as strong. However, if the association of red meat and colorectal
 cancer were proven to be causal, data from the same studies suggest 
that the risk of colorectal cancer could increase by 17% for every 100 
gram portion of red meat eaten daily."
"Is the risk higher in children, in elderly people, in women, or in men? Are some people more at risk?",The available data did not allow conclusions about whether the risks differ in different groups of people.
What about people who have had colon cancer? Should they stop eating red meat?,The available data did not allow conclusions about risks to people who have already had cancer.
Should I stop eating meat?,"Eating meat has known health benefits. Many national health 
recommendations advise people to limit intake of processed meat and red 
meat, which are linked to increased risks of death from heart disease, 
diabetes, and other illnesses."
Up to what age can a baby stay well nourished by just being breastfed?,"Infants should be exclusively breastfed – i.e. receive

How much meat is it safe to eat?,"The risk increases with the amount of meat consumed, but the data 
available for evaluation did not permit a conclusion about whether a 
safe level exists."
What is WHO’s health recommendation to prevent cancer risk associated with eating red meat and processed meat?,"IARC is a research organization that evaluates the evidence 
available on the causes of cancer but does not make health 
recommendations as such. National governments and WHO are responsible 
for developing nutritional guidelines. This evaluation by IARC 
reinforces a 2002 recommendation from WHO that people who eat meat 
should moderate the consumption of processed meat to reduce the risk of 
colorectal cancer. Some other dietary guidelines also recommend limiting
 consumption of red meat or processed meat, but these are focused mainly
 on reducing the intake of fat and sodium, which are risk factors for 
cardiovascular disease and obesity. Individuals who are concerned about 
cancer could consider reducing their consumption of red meat or 
processed meat until updated guidelines related specifically to cancer 
have been developed."
Should we eat only poultry and fish?,The cancer risks associated with consumption of poultry and fish were not evaluated.
Should we be vegetarians?,"Vegetarian diets and diets that include meat have different 
advantages and disadvantages for health. However, this evaluation did 
not directly compare health risks in vegetarians and people who eat 
meat. That type of comparison is difficult because these groups can be 
different in other ways besides their consumption of meat."
Is there a type of red meat that is safer?,"A few studies have investigated the cancer risks associated with 
different types of red meat, such as beef and pork, and with different 
kinds of processed meats, like ham and hot dogs. However, there is not 
enough information to say whether higher or lower cancer risks are 
related to eating any particular type of red meat or processed meat."
"Could the preservation method influence the risk (e.g. salting, deep-freezing, or irradiation)?","Different preservation methods could result in the formation of 
carcinogens (e.g. N-nitroso compounds), but whether and how much this 
contributes to the cancer risk is unknown."
How many studies were evaluated?,"The IARC Working Group considered more than 800 different studies 
on cancer in humans (some studies provided data on both types of meat; 
in total more than 700 epidemiological studies provided data on red meat
 and more than 400 epidemiological studies provided data on processed 
meat)."
How many experts were involved in the evaluation?,The IARC Working Group consisted of 22 experts from 10 countries.
What actions do you think governments should take based on your results?,"IARC is a research organization that evaluates the evidence on the
 causes of cancer but does not make health recommendations as such. The 
IARC Monographs are, however, often used as a basis for making national 
and international policies, guidelines and recommendations to minimize 
cancer risks. Governments may decide to include this new information on 
the cancer hazards of processed meat in the context of other health 
risks and benefits in updating dietary recommendations."
What can I do to avoid a heart attack or a stroke?,"WHO estimates that more than 17.5 million people died of 
cardiovascular diseases such as heart attack or stroke in 2012. Contrary
 to popular belief, more than 3 out of 4 of these deaths occurred in 
low- and middle-income countries, and men and women were equally 
affected.
		The good news, however, is that 80% of premature heart attacks
 and strokes are preventable. Healthy diet, regular physical activity, 
and not using tobacco products are the keys to prevention. Checking and 
controlling risk factors for heart disease and stroke such as high blood
 pressure, high cholesterol and high blood sugar or diabetes is also 
very important.Eat a healthy diet: A balanced diet is crucial to a 
healthy heart and circulation system. This should include plenty of 
fruit and vegetables, whole grains, lean meat, fish and pulses with 
restricted salt, sugar and fat intake. Alcohol should also be used in 
moderation.Take regular physical activity: At least 30 minutes of 
regular physical activity every day helps to maintain cardiovascular 
fitness; at least 60 minutes on most days of the week helps to maintain 
healthy weight.Avoid tobacco use: Tobacco in every form is very 
harmful to health - cigarettes, cigars, pipes, or chewable tobacco. 
Exposure to second-hand tobacco smoke is also dangerous. The risk of 
heart attack and stroke starts to drop immediately after a person stops 
using tobacco products, and can drop by as much as half after 1 year.Check and control your overall cardiovascular risk: An 
important aspect of preventing heart attacks and strokes is by providing
 treatment and counselling to individuals at high risk (those with a 10 
year cardiovascular risk equal to or above 30%) and reducing their 
cardiovascular risk. A health worker can estimate your cardiovascular 
risk using simple risk charts and provide the appropriate advice for 
managing your risk factors.Know your blood pressure: High blood pressure usually has 
no symptoms, but is one of the biggest causes of sudden stroke or heart 
attack. Have your blood pressure checked and know your numbers. If it is
 high, you will need to change your lifestyle to incorporate a healthy 
diet with less salt intake and increase physical activity, and may need 
medications to control your blood pressure.Know your blood lipids: Raised blood cholesterol and 
abnormal blood lipids increase the risk of heart attacks and strokes. 
Blood cholesterol needs to be controlled through a healthy diet and, if 
necessary, by appropriate medications.Know your blood sugar: Raised blood glucose (diabetes) 
increases the risk of heart attacks and strokes. If you have diabetes it
 is very important to control your blood pressure and blood sugar to 
minimize the risk."
What are the common health problems of refugees and migrants arriving in the European Region?,"The health problems of refugees and migrants are similar to 
those of the rest of the population, although some groups may have a 
higher prevalence. The most frequent health problems of newly arrived 
migrants include accidental injuries, hypothermia, burns, cardiovascular
 events, pregnancy and delivery-related complications, diabetes and 
hypertension. Female migrants frequently face specific challenges, 
particularly in maternal, newborn and child health, sexual and 
reproductive health, and violence. 
		The exposure of migrants to the risks associated with 
population movements – psychosocial disorders, reproductive health 
problems, higher newborn mortality, drug abuse, nutrition disorders, 
alcoholism and exposure to violence – increase their vulnerability to 
noncommunicable diseases (NCDs). The key issue with regard to NCDs is 
the interruption of care, due either to lack of access or to the 
decimation of health care systems and providers; displacement results in
 interruption of the continuous treatment that is crucial for chronic 
conditions. Vulnerable children are prone to acute infections such as 
respiratory infections and diarrhoea because of poor living conditions 
and deprivation during migration, and they require access to acute care.
 Lack of hygiene can lead to skin infections. Furthermore, the number of
 casualties and deaths among refugees and migrants crossing the 
Mediterranean Sea has increased rapidly, with a reported 1867 people 
drowned or missing at sea in the first 6 months of 2015, according to 
the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)."
What are the WHO recommendations for triage and screening of migrants upon arrival?,"WHO does not recommend obligatory screening of refugee and 
migrant populations for diseases, because there is no clear evidence of 
benefits (or cost-effectiveness); furthermore, it can trigger anxiety in
 individual refugees and the wider community. 
		WHO strongly recommends offering and providing health checks 
to ensure access to health care for all refugees and migrants in need of
 health protection. Health checks should be done for both communicable 
and NCDs, with respect for migrants' human rights and dignity.The results of screening must never be used as a reason or justification for ejecting a refugee or a migrant from a country.Obligatory screening deters migrants from asking for a medical check-up and jeopardizes identification of high-risk patients.In spite of the common perception that there is an association 
between migration and the importation of infectious diseases, there is 
no systematic association. Refugees and migrants are exposed mainly to 
the infectious diseases that are common in Europe, independently of 
migration. The risk that exotic infectious agents, such as Ebola virus, 
will be imported into Europe is extremely low, and when it occurs, 
experience shows that it affects regular travellers, tourists or health 
care workers rather than refugees or migrants.Triage is recommended at points of entry to identify health 
problems in refugees and migrants soon after their arrival. Proper 
diagnosis and treatment must follow, and the necessary health care must 
be ensured for specific population groups (children, pregnant women, 
elderly). Each and every person on the move must have full access to a 
hospitable environment, to prevention (e.g. vaccination) and, when 
needed, to high-quality health care, without discrimination on the basis
 of gender, age, religion, nationality or race. This is the safest way 
to ensure that the resident population is not unnecessarily exposed to 
imported infectious agents. WHO supports policies to provide health care
 services to migrants and refugees irrespective of their legal status as
 part of universal health coverage."
What does WHO recommend with regard to vaccination for newly arrived migrants?,"Transmission of vaccine-preventable diseases to host country 
populations is just as likely to happen after the return of a resident 
of that country from a holiday in an endemic country as after the 
arrival of a migrant from the country. There are still large gaps in the
 immunity of populations across the Region, either because countries 
decide not to avail themselves of the benefits of vaccination or because
 of limited access to vaccination services.
		The WHO Regional Office for Europe does not routinely collect 
information on transmission of vaccine-preventable diseases among 
migrants or on their immunization coverage. However, well-documented 
outbreaks of measles have originated by transmission from migrants, 
mobile populations, international travellers and tourists alike. Equitable access to vaccination is of prime importance and is 
one of the objectives of the European Vaccine Action Plan 2015–2020. The
 plan proposes that all countries in the Region pay special attention to
 ensuring the eligibility and access of migrants, international 
travellers and marginalized communities to (culturally) appropriate 
vaccination services and information. We applaud the many countries, 
such as those receiving large influxes of migrants, that are including 
migrants into their routine vaccination programmes. More on immunization coverage of all countries"
What health care access does WHO recommend for refugees and migrants?,"Legal status is one of the most important determinants of the 
access of migrants to health services in a country. Each and every 
refugee and migrant must have full, uninterrupted access to a hospitable
 environment and, when needed, to high-quality health care, without 
discrimination on the basis of gender, age, religion, nationality or 
race. WHO supports policies to provide health care services irrespective
 of migrants' legal status. As rapid access to health care can result in
 cure, it can avoid the spread of diseases; it is therefore in the 
interest of both migrants and the receiving country, to ensure that the 
resident population is not unnecessarily exposed to the importation of 
infectious agents. Likewise, diagnosis and treatment of NCDs such as 
diabetes and hypertension can prevent these conditions from worsening 
and becoming life-threatening."
What is WHO doing to address the public health implications of the large influxes of refugees and migrants into the European Region?,"WHO works to: 
develop migrant-sensitive health policies; strengthen health systems to provide equitable access to services;establish information systems to assess migrant health; share information on best practices; increase the cultural and gender sensitivity and specific training of health service providers and professionals; and promote multilateral cooperation among countries in 
accordance with resolution WHA61.17 on the health of migrants endorsed 
by the Sixty-first World Health Assembly in 2008.WHO has been working on the health issues related to people's 
movements for many years. The WHO European health policy framework 
Health 2020 has drawn particular attention to migration and health, with
 population vulnerability and human rights. Following the political, 
economic and humanitarian crises in the north of Africa and the Middle 
East, WHO, in collaboration with the Italian Ministry of Health, 
established the Public Health Aspects of Migration in Europe project in 
April 2012. The aims are: to strengthen health system capacity to meet the health needs of mixed inflows of migrants and host populations; promote immediate health interventions; ensure migrant-sensitive health policies; improve the quality of the health services delivered; and optimize use of health structures and resources in countries receiving migrant populations. Up to August 2015, the Regional Office had conducted joint 
assessment missions with ministries of health in Bulgaria, Cyprus, 
Greece, Italy, Malta, Portugal, Serbia and Spain, with the new ""Toolkit 
for assessing health system capacity to manage large influxes of 
migrants in the acute phase,"" to respond to and address the complex, 
resource-intensive, multisectoral, politically sensitive issues in 
health and migration."
Why do so many women still die in pregnancy or childbirth?,"In 2015, an estimated 303 000 women will die from complications
 related to pregnancy or childbirth. In addition, for every woman who 
dies in childbirth, dozens more suffer injury, infection or disease.
		The majority of maternal deaths are due to haemorrhage, 
infection, unsafe abortion, and eclampsia (very high blood pressure 
leading to seizures), or from health complications worsened in 
pregnancy. In all these cases,  unavailable, inaccessible, unaffordable,
 or poor quality care is fundamentally responsible. Maternal deaths are 
detrimental to social development and wellbeing, as some 1 million 
children are left motherless each year. These children are more likely 
to die within 1-2 years of their mothers' death.Women need not die in childbirth. We must give a young woman 
the information and support she needs to address her reproductive health
 needs, help her through a pregnancy, and care for her and her newborn 
well into childhood. The vast majority of maternal deaths could be 
prevented if women had access to quality family planning services; 
skilled care during pregnancy, childbirth and after delivery; or 
post-abortion care and where permissible, safe abortion services.  
Increased attention for women living in conflict situations, or under 
humanitarian crisis is needed because a working health system with 
skilled personnel is key to saving these women's lives.Although the world did not achieve the Millennium Development 
Goal of reducing maternal mortality by three quarters between 1990 and 
2015; great strides were made and many countries saw significant 
improvements in maternal health.  Looking beyond 2015, WHO is committed 
to support accelerated reductions in maternal mortality by 2030, as part
 of the Sustainable Development Goals agenda.  For this to happen, high 
quality reproductive, maternal and newborn health care must be 
available, accessible and acceptable to all in need.  As part of the 
Ending Preventable Maternal Mortality Strategy and objectives, WHO and 
partners support countries to achieve this goal, so that women, girls 
and adolescents can survive and thrive."
What is raised blood pressure (hypertension)?,"Hypertension, also known as high or raised blood pressure, is a
 condition in which the blood vessels have persistently raised pressure,
 putting them under increased stress. Each time the heart beats; it 
pumps blood into the vessels, which carry the blood throughout the body.
 Blood pressure is created by the force of blood pushing against the 
walls of blood vessels (arteries) as it is pumped by the heart. The 
higher the pressure, the harder the heart has to pump.
		Normal adult blood pressure is defined as a blood pressure of 120 mm Hg1
 when the heart beats (systolic) and a blood pressure of 80 mm Hg when 
the heart relaxes (diastolic). When systolic blood pressure is equal to 
or above 140 mm Hg and/or a diastolic blood pressure equal to or above 
90 mm Hg the blood pressure is considered to be raised or high.Most people with hypertension have no symptoms at all; this is
 why it is known as the “silent killer”. Sometimes hypertension causes 
symptoms such as headache, shortness of breath, dizziness, chest pain, 
palpitations of the heart and nose bleeds, but not always."
Why is raised blood pressure dangerous?,"The higher the blood pressure, the higher the risk of damage to
 the heart and blood vessels in major organs such as the brain and 
kidneys. Hypertension is the most important preventable cause of heart 
disease and stroke worldwide.
		If left uncontrolled, hypertension can lead to a heart attack,
 an enlargement of the heart and eventually heart failure. Blood vessels
 may develop bulges (aneurysms) and weak spots that make them more 
likely to clog and burst. The pressure in the blood vessels can cause 
blood to leak out into the brain and cause a stroke. Hypertension can 
also lead to kidney failure, blindness, and cognitive impairment. The health consequences of hypertension can be compounded by 
other factors that increase the odds of heart attack, stroke and kidney 
failure. These factors include tobacco use, unhealthy diet, harmful use 
of alcohol, lack of physical activity, and exposure to persistent stress
 as well as obesity, high cholesterol and diabetes mellitus."
How can raised blood pressure be prevented and treated?,"All adults should have their blood pressure checked. routinely,
 it is important to know your numbers. If blood pressure is high, they 
need the advice of a health worker.
		For some people, lifestyle changes such as stopping tobacco 
use, eating healthily, exercising regularly and avoiding the harmful use
 of alcohol, are sufficient to control blood pressure. Reduction in salt
 intake can also help. For others, these changes are insufficient and 
they need prescription medication to control blood pressure.Adults can support treatment by adhering to the prescribed medication, lifestyle changes and by monitoring their health.People with high blood pressure that also have high blood 
sugar, elevated blood cholesterol or kidney damage face even higher risk
 of heart attacks and stroke. Therefore it is important that regular 
checks for blood sugar, blood cholesterol and urine albumin take place.Everyone can take five concrete steps to minimize the odds of developing high blood pressure and its adverse consequences. Healthy diet:promoting a healthy lifestyle with emphasis on proper nutrition for infants and young people;reducing salt intake to less than 5 g of salt per day (just under a teaspoon);eating five servings of fruit and vegetables a day;reducing saturated and total fat intake.Avoiding harmful use of alcohol i.e.  limit intake to no more than one standard drink a dayPhysical activity:regular physical activity and promotion of physical activity for children and young people (at least 30 minutes a day). maintaining a normal weight: every 5 kg of excess weight lost can reduce systolic blood pressure by 2 to 10 points.Stopping tobacco use and exposure to tobacco productsManaging stress in healthy way such as through meditation, appropriate physical exercise, and positive social contact."
How common is raised blood pressure?,"More than 1 in 5 adults worldwide have raised blood pressure – a
 condition that causes around half of all deaths from stroke and heart 
disease. Complications from hypertension account for 9.4 million deaths 
worldwide every year.
		In nearly all high-income countries, widespread diagnosis and 
treatment with low-cost medication have led to a significant drop in the
 proportion of people with raised blood pressure, as well as the average
 blood pressure across populations – and this has contributed to a 
reduction in deaths from heart disease. For example, the prevalence of 
raised blood pressure in the WHO region of the Americas in 2014 was 18%,
 as compared to 31% in 1980.In contrast, low-income countries have the highest prevalence 
of raised blood pressure. In the WHO African region, more than 30% of 
adults in many countries are estimated to have high blood pressure and 
this proportion is increasing. Furthermore, the average blood pressure 
levels in this region are much higher than global averages.Many people with high blood pressure in developing countries 
are not aware of their disease, and do not have access to treatments 
that could control their blood pressure and significantly reduce their 
risk of death and disability from heart disease and stroke. Detection, 
treatment and control of hypertension is an important health priority 
worldwide."
What does “preterm” mean?,"Preterm refers to a baby born before 37 weeks of pregnancy have been completed. Normally, a pregnancy lasts about 40 weeks."
How many babies are born preterm every year and where?,"Preterm birth is a global problem. It occurs in high, low, and middle-income countries. About 15 million babies are born preterm each year; that is more than 1 in 10 babies worldwide. 60% of them are born in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia."
How do preterm births occur?,"Most preterm births happen spontaneously, but some are due to early induction of labour or caesarean birth, whether for medical or non-medical reasons."
Is there a way to tell if you are at risk of having a preterm baby?,"There is no test that can accurately predict who might have a preterm birth. We do not fully understand the causes of preterm births.There are several factors that may put a pregnant woman at higher risk of a preterm birth, including a previous preterm birth, multiple pregnancies such as twins, triplets, etc, some chronic medical conditions such as high blood pressure, diabetes and infections. Pregnancy in adolescence is a major risk factor for preterm birth."
Can a pregnant woman’s lifestyle put her at risk of a preterm birth?,"Women who smoke cigarettes, drink alcohol or take other recreational drugs are at a higher risk of having preterm babies. Stress from any cause is also known to increase a woman’s risk of having preterm birth."
How many preterm babies could be saved?,"Around 1 million preterm babies die each year. Those babies who survive can face lifelong physical, neurological or learning disabilities, often at great cost to families and society.An estimated three-quarters of these preterm babies could survive if they had access to proven and often inexpensive care – like warmth, breastfeeding support, and basic care for infections and breathing difficulties.Though preterm births occur in high-income countries, access to these proven interventions means that almost 9 out of every 10 preterm babies survive in those settings in sharp contrast to about 1 out of 10 in low-income countries."
Why do preterm babies need special care?,"Preterm babies are not fully prepared to live in the world outside their mother’s womb. They get cold more easily and may need more help feeding than full-term babies. Because their bodies are not yet fully developed, they may have problems breathing and can also suffer from other complications including infections."
What is an Emergency Medical Team (EMT)?,"EMTs are groups of health professionals (doctors, nurses, paramedics etc.) that treat patients affected by an emergency or disaster. They come from governments, charities (NGOs), militaries and international organizations such as the International Red Cross/Red Crescent movement. They work to comply with the classification and minimum standards set by WHO and its partners, and come trained and self-sufficient so as not to burden the national system.Emergency medical teams have a long history of respondinig to sudden onset disasters (SOD) such as the Haiti earthquake, the Indian Ocean Tsunami and the floods in Pakistan.EMTs historically have had a trauma and surgical focus, but Ebola has shown us their value in outbreak response and other forms of emergency.The Ebola response was the largest deployment of EMTs for an outbreak (58 teams), which pales in comparison to the 151 teams deployed to respond to Typhoon Haiyan in November 2013 and the nearly 300 teams deployed to Haiti following the earthquake.Requirements for emergency health response are broader than those required for sudden onset disasters and trauma. They must include the ability to care for diseases such as cholera, Shigella and Ebola, as well as teams to support populations affected by flood, conflict and protracted crises such as famine."
How do we define an EMT?,EMTs work under the guidelines of the WHO Classification and Minimum Standards for Foreign Medical Teams in sudden onset disasters guidance. These guidelines discuss the principles and core standards of how registered EMTs must function and declare their operational capabilities. The electronic version of these guidelines can be found from the link below.Classification and minimum standards for Emergency Medical Teams in sudden onset disasters
What is the work of WHO to date in this area?,"Classification and minimum standards were published in mid-2013.These standards were used for the first time successfully in November 2013, following typhoon Haiyan. The Department of Health Philippines coordinated the deployment of 151 EMTs and found the new classification system fit for purpose.A new EMT unit was set up in the department of Emergency Risk Management & Humanitarian Response, WHO, Geneva, in February 2014.Their work has included:Building a new global registration system that will allow EMTs to register their capacity and be classified.Progression of EMT coordination in Southeast Asia, the Americas, Caribbean, Europe and the Pacific.Closer collaboration with UN OCHA, INSARAG (International Search and Rescue Advisory Group), UNDAC (UN Disaster Assessment and Coordination) teams and use by FMTs of the UN OSOCC (onsite operations and coordination centre) mechanisms.Regional exercises in the Americas with Urban Search and Rescue and EMTs co-deployed.Next steps for 2015 include:Working with countries to develop their national medical response team capacityTraining national ministries of health, in countries likely to suffer natural disasters, to be aware of the capacities of FMTs, and establish arrangements for the reception and coordination of teams on arrival.Development of best practice guidance and standards for FMTs to respond to the care of children, pregnant women, patients with disabilities, older people, and those with pre-existing health issues who have lost access to their medication during the disaster etc."
What is the Global EMT Registry?,"WHO has developed a global registration system where emergency medical teams can be verified and classified ready to be deployed to health emergencies. A global registry of all EMTs that meet the WHO EMT minimum standards for deployment in sudden onset emergencies from all-hazards provides time-limited surge clinical capacity to the affected populations. It serves as a deployment and coordination mechanism for all partners who aim to provide clinical care in emergencies such as tsunami, earthquake, flood, and more recently, in large outbreaks, such as the West Africa Ebola outbreak, which require a surge in clinical care capacity. It allows a country affected by a disaster or other emergency to call on teams that have been pre-registered and quality assured."
What are its aims?,"Improve the quality of care providedImprove coordination between clinical care teamsProvide a predictable and timely response to affected governments and populationsServe as a quality improvement forum, with working groups developing minimum standards, best practice guidance, and sharing best practice between partnersProvide a forum for interaction between EMT providers and potential recipient countries, including allow countries to inform EMTs of the specific standard operating procedures (SOPs) and requirements for access to their country in the event of an emergency. (e.g. rules on importation of pain relief, registration as a doctor, etc.)"
What does the Global Registry enable countries to do?,"It enables countries to improve their own national capacity, which they are then able to use to assist other countries in emergencies.It enables affected countries to accept and use EMTs in a timely, coordinated manner.Host governments and affected populations can depend on FMTs from the registry to arrive trained, equipped and capable of providing the intervention promised. Victims and their families can expect the clinical teams treating them to be of a safe minimum standard.Each team has unique individuals with various skill sets. Identifying these differences and placing them into the field requires coordination and communication to ensure the correct gaps are filled. EMT staff help facilitate and coordinate this placement.Offers of EMT assistance are more likely to be accepted if teams have pre-registered and have demonstrated their quality. Pre-registration will expedite arrival and tasking procedures in-country. Registered teams will be working within the national and international response effort rather than apart.Donors will have surety that the EMTs registered will have reached a minimum standard and would be able to offer a preferred list of accredited medical organisations that could be supported financially and through other means.The global community is now able to build around a predictable and described clinical surge capacity and can use this registry to examine capabilities and gaps for local response to various emergencies."
Can Zika virus be transmitted through donated blood?,"Zika virus may present a risk to blood safety. Currently there
 is a limited knowledge of Zika virus and the ways it can be 
transmitted. The majority of cases are transmitted to people through the
 bite of an infected mosquito, Aedes mosquitos. Until more is 
known about other means of transmission, precautions should be taken to 
ensure the supply of blood is safe. Zika virus has been detected in blood donors in affected areas.Transmission of related flaviviruses (dengue and West Nile virus)
 by blood transfusion has been documented, and thus transmission of Zika
 virus is possible. Recently 2 probable cases of Zika virus transmission by blood transfusion have been reported from Campinas, Brazil."
What precautions should be taken to ensure that the blood supply is safe in countries where Zika infection is occurring?,"Ideally the blood supply during a regional outbreak of Zika should
 be maintained by increasing blood collections in non-affected areas. In
 non-affected areas, consideration may be given to defer potential 
donors who have recently visited areas with ongoing transmission of Zika
 virus infection for 28 days after their departure from these areas."
What about blood donations in areas affected by Zika?,"Blood collection may need to continue in affected areas to meet 
needs for blood and its components. This may be necessary when an 
outbreak is affecting a large swathe of a country or when it is not 
possible to get blood from regions where Zika is not circulating."
What measures may be considered for reducing the risk of Zika virus through blood transfusion in areas with active Zika virus transmission?,"Temporary exclusion of donors with a recent clinical history 
consistent with Zika virus disease, such as a combination of fever or 
rash with pinkeye, muscle aches, headache or malaise. Temporary exclusion of donors for whom laboratory test results show they may recently have been infected. Donors with clinical history consistent with Zika virus disease 
or a recent history of Zika virus infection should be deferred for a 
period not less than 28 days following the full resolution of symptoms.Similarly, sex partners of men with confirmed or suspected Zika 
virus infection in the last 3 months should be deferred for at least 28 
days after their last sexual contact.People who have already donated must be encouraged to report to 
the blood transfusion service if they subsequently get symptoms of Zika 
virus infection, or if they are diagnosed with recent Zika virus 
infection within 14 days after blood donation.Blood components of appropriate shelf life (e.g. red blood cells)
 may be quarantined for a period of 7–14 days and released following 
confirmation from the donor that he or she has not experienced symptoms 
consistent with the acute phase of Zika virus infection. For platelets, 
which have a shorter shelf life, a 3-day quarantine period may be 
considered.Countries with many visitors to affected countries may need to 
assess the impact of deferral on blood supply availability and weigh the
 risks against the benefits of restricting donations."
How could blood donations be tested for the presence of Zika virus?,"Where possible, blood donations may be tested for the presence of 
Zika virus by appropriate tests.  Likely, pathogen reduction technology 
(PRT) may be implemented for plasma and platelets.In some cases, the selective testing for the presence of the virus in blood donors returning from affected countries may be considered as an alternative to deferral."
Should countries prepare that only have the Aedes mosquitoes but where the Zika virus has not been found?,"WHO recommends that countries where the mosquito that carries Zika
 exists, yet the virus itself has not been found, consider preparing a 
plan to ensure the availability of a safe and sufficient supply of blood
 should an outbreak occur."
What is the role of EMTs in the Ebola Response?,"Traditionally, EMTs were used for sudden onset disasters like earthquakes and typhoons, with a trauma and surgical focus. Ebola care during this multi-country outbreak has necessitated unique medical knowledge and equipment, and has carried unique risks for health care workers. The progress made against Ebola is part thanks to the response by the national and international teams that run the 72 Ebola Treatment Centres (ETCs) across three countries.WHO and the world have learned important lessons from the Ebola response that have a wider application to the agency and the global health response community. These lessons have been used to improve coordination, quality and predictability of clinical response teams deploying with surge capacity as EMTs.Over 40 organizations, including international NGOs, military, faith-based organizations and governments have deployed EMTs throughout the current Ebola Response.Countries that have sent EMTs to West Africa include Australia, China, Cuba, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Denmark, Ethiopia, France, Germany,Kenya, Korea, New Zealand, Nigeria, Norway, Russia, South Africa, Sweden, Uganda, United Kingdom and United States of America."
What are the risks of diabetes in children?,"The frequency of diabetes is rising around the world, and studies are showing children are at increasing risk of developing the disease. Over time, diabetes can damage the heart, blood vessels, eyes, kidneys and nerves - causing chronic problems and early death.Type 1 diabetesType 1 diabetes (sometimes called insulin-dependent, juvenile or childhood-onset diabetes) occurs when the pancreas does not produce enough insulin, a hormone that regulates blood sugar. The cause is not known, but it is thought to be the result of a combination of genetic and environmental factors.Many countries are documenting higher numbers of newly diagnosed cases of type 1 diabetes, particularly in younger children. Interestingly, some disease patterns among children resemble infectious disease epidemics. Currently, there is no known way to prevent type 1 diabetes.Type 2 diabetesType 2 diabetes (sometimes called non-insulin-dependent or adult-onset diabetes) happens when the body cannot effectively use the insulin it produces. Often preventable, it can result from excess body weight and physical inactivity, and sometimes, a genetic predisposition.Recently, type 2 diabetes has increasingly been reported in children and adolescents, so much so that in some parts of the world type 2 diabetes has become the main type of diabetes in children. The global rise of childhood obesity and physical inactivity is widely believed to play a crucial role. Healthy eating and lifestyle habits are a strong defence against the disease."
Do all mosquitoes transmit malaria?,"Only certain species of mosquitoes of the Anopheles genus—and only females of those species—can transmit malaria.
		Malaria is caused by a one-celled parasite called a Plasmodium. Female Anopheles
 mosquitoes pick up the parasite from infected people when they bite to 
obtain blood needed to nurture their eggs. Inside the mosquito the 
parasites reproduce and develop. When the mosquito bites again, the 
parasites contained in the salivary gland are injected and pass into the
 blood of the person being bitten.Malaria parasites multiply rapidly in the liver and then in 
red blood cells of the infected person. One to two weeks after a person 
is infected the first symptoms of malaria appear: usually fever, 
headache, chills and vomiting. If not treated promptly with effective 
medicines, malaria can kill by infecting and destroying red blood cells 
and by clogging the capillaries that carry blood to the brain or other 
vital organs.There are four types of human malaria: Plasmodium vivax, P. malariae, P. ovale and P. falciparum. P. vivax and P. falciparum
 are the most common forms. Falciparum malaria—the most deadly type—is 
most common in sub-Saharan Africa, where it causes more than 400 000  
deaths a year.In recent years, some human cases of malaria have also occurred with Plasmodium knowlesi – a species that causes malaria among monkeys and occurs in certain forested areas of South-East Asia."
What are neurological disorders and how many people are affected by them?,"Neurological disorders are diseases of the central and 
peripheral nervous system. In other words, the brain, spinal cord, 
cranial nerves, peripheral nerves, nerve roots, autonomic nervous 
system, neuromuscular junction, and muscles. These disorders include 
epilepsy, Alzheimer disease and other dementias, cerebrovascular 
diseases including stroke, migraine and other headache disorders, 
multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, neuroinfections, brain tumours,
 traumatic disorders of the nervous system due to head trauma, and 
neurological disorders as a result of malnutrition. 
		Many bacterial (i.e. Mycobacterial tuberculosis, Neisseria 
meningitides), viral (i.e. Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), 
Enteroviruses, West Nile Virus, Zika), fungal (i.e. Cryptococcus, 
Aspergillus), and parasitic (i.e. malaria, Chagas) infections can affect
 the nervous system. Neurological symptoms may occur due to the 
infection itself, or due to an immune response.Hundreds of millions of people worldwide are affected by 
neurological disorders. More than 6 million people die because of stroke
 each year; over 80% of these deaths take place in low- and 
middle-income countries. More than 50 million people have epilepsy 
worldwide. It is estimated that there are globally 47.5 million people 
with dementia with 7.7 million new cases every year - Alzheimer's 
disease is the most common cause of dementia and may contribute to 
60–70% of cases. The prevalence of migraine is more than 10% worldwide."
What are the health risks associated with pesticide residues in food?,"Pesticides are chemicals used in agriculture to protect crops 
against insects, fungi, weeds and other pests. In addition to their use 
in agriculture, pesticides are also used to protect public health in 
controlling the vectors of tropical diseases, such as mosquitoes.But pesticides are also potentially toxic to humans. They may 
induce adverse health effects including cancer, effects on reproduction,
 immune or nervous systems. Before they can be authorized for use, 
pesticides should be tested for all possible health effects and the 
results should be analysed by experts to assess any risks to humans."
“Hazard” and “risk”: what is the difference?,"Scientific studies of the potential health effects of 
hazardous chemicals, such as pesticides, allow them to be classified as 
carcinogenic (can cause cancer), neurotoxic (can cause damage to the 
brain), or teratogenic (can cause damage to a fetus). This process of 
classification, called “hazard identification,” is the first step of 
“risk assessment”. An example of hazard identification is the 
classification of substances according to their carcinogenicity to 
humans carried out by the International Agency for Research on Cancer 
(IARC), the specialized cancer agency of WHO.The same chemical can have different effects at different 
doses, which depends on how much of the chemical a person is exposed to.
 It can also depend on the route by which the exposure occurs, e.g. 
ingestion, inhalation or injection."
Why does WHO have 2 distinct processes for “hazard identification” and “risk assessment”?,"“Hazard identification”—in particular, the IARC classification
 of substances in terms of their carcinogenicity—is the first step of 
the “risk assessment” process. Classification of an agent as a 
carcinogenic hazard is an important indication that some level of 
exposure, for example from occupation, environment, food, etc., could 
result in an increased risk of cancer.Risk assessment for pesticide residues in food, as conducted 
by the Joint FAO/WHO Meeting on Pesticide Residues (JMPR), establishes a
 safe intake level after assessing the level of risk. Acceptable daily 
intakes (ADIs) are used by governments and international risk managers, 
such as the Codex Alimentarius Commission, to establish maximum residue 
limits (MRLs) for pesticides in food. MRLs are enforced by national 
authorities to ensure that the amount of pesticide residues consumers 
are exposed to through eating food over a lifetime will not have adverse
 health effects.IARC’s hazard identification can inform the JMPR’s risk 
assessment, and thus the two processes can be complementary. For 
example, IARC may identify new evidence from scientific studies on the 
carcinogenicity of a chemical and, when necessary, JMPR conducts an 
evaluation or a re-evaluation of the safety of that chemical as it is 
used in agriculture and occurs in food."
What are the International Health Regulations?,"The International Health Regulations (2005), or IHR (2005), represents a binding international legal agreement involving 196 countries across the globe, including all the Member States of WHO. Their aim is to help the international community prevent and respond to acute public health risks that have the potential to cross borders and threaten people worldwide. The purpose and scope of the IHR (2005) is to prevent, protect against, control and provide a public health response to the international spread of disease in ways that are commensurate with and restricted to public health risks, and which avoid unnecessary interference with international traffic and trade."
How does the IHR Emergency Committee work?,"The Emergency Committee is made up of international experts who provide technical advice to the WHO Director-General in the context of a “public health emergency of international concern” (PHEIC) The Committee provides views on:whether the event constitutes a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC);the Temporary Recommendations that should be taken by the country experiencing an emergency of international concern, or by other countries, to prevent or reduce the international spread of disease and avoid unnecessary interference with international trade and travel; andthe termination of a PHEIC.The Director-General makes the final determination of a PHEIC and Temporary Recommendations to address the situation, based on advice from the Emergency Committee, information provided by the State Parties, scientific experts and an assessment of risk to human health, risk of international spread of disease and of risk of interference with international travel.Under the IHR (2005), Temporary Recommendations automatically expire three months after their issuance. Emergency Committees are therefore reconvened at least every 3 months to review the current epidemiological situation and to review whether the event continues to be a public health emergency of international concern and whether changes need to be made to the Temporary Recommendations. A statement of the Emergency Committee meeting is published on the WHO website after each meeting of the Committee."
What is a public health emergency of international concern?,"A PHEIC is defined in the IHR (2005) as, “an extraordinary event which is determined to constitute a public health risk to other States through the international spread of disease and to potentially require a coordinated international response”. This definition implies a situation that is:serious, sudden, unusual or unexpected;carries implications for public health beyond the affected State’s national border; andmay require immediate international action."
Who are the members of an IHR Emergency Committee?,"Members of an IHR Emergency Committee are drawn from the IHR Experts Roster, established by the Director-General, and, where appropriate, from other WHO expert advisory panels. The IHR Expert Roster is composed of international experts in fields such as disease control, virology, vaccine development or infectious disease epidemiology.Members can be selected on the basis of expertise required for any particular session. At least 1 member of the Emergency Committee should be an expert nominated by a State Party within whose territory the event arises. These States Parties are invited to present their views to the Emergency Committee. The Director-General may also appoint 1 or more technical experts to advise the Committee, on his or her own initiative or at the request of the Committee.Persons who are neither members of the IHR Experts Roster nor other WHO Expert Advisory Panels could be appointed as technical experts to advise the Committee, but not as members of the Committee.The names of members and advisers to an IHR Emergency Committee, their job titles and any other information that could be determined to be a potential conflict of interest are published on WHO’s website."
How are the members of an IHR Emergency Committee chosen?,"Selection of members is based primarily on their technical ability and experience in the relevant fields of expertise. The Director-General aims to ensure that members of the IHR Emergency Committee have the broadest possible geographical representation and reflect diverse knowledge, practical experience and approaches. Achieving gender balance is also a desirable aim.Members of WHO advisory panels and committees do not receive any remuneration from the Organization."
How are people appointed to the expert advisory panels?,"A member of an expert advisory panel is an expert appointed by the DG.An expert advisory panel may be established by the DG in any field, as and when required by the development of the Organization’s programme.Any person possessing qualifications and/or experience relevant and useful to the activities of the Organization in a field covered by an established expert advisory panel may be considered for appointment as a member of that panel – after consultations with the national authorities concerned."
What is the ICG?,"The ICG was established in 1997, following major outbreaks of meningitis in Africa, as a mechanism to manage and coordinate the provision of emergency vaccine supplies and antibiotics to countries during major outbreaks. Working closely with vaccine producers,
    through WHO and UNICEF, and following disease trends, the ICG monitors its vaccine security global stock levels for cholera, meningitis and yellow fever to ensure availability of sufficient supply to respond to disease outbreaks when they occur.The ICG brings partners together to improve cooperation and coordination of epidemic preparedness and response. The ICG also works on forecasting vaccine stocks, negotiating vaccine prices through its networks or partners, evaluating interventions and
    standard protocols for managing diseases.The ICG's mission is to:Rapidly deliver vaccines to respond to disease outbreaks;Provide equitable vaccine allocation through careful assessment of risk, based on epidemiological and operational criteria;Coordinate the use of limited amounts of vaccines and essential medicines;Reduce wastage of vaccines and supplies;Advocate for readily available, low-cost vaccines and medicines;Work with manufacturers through UNICEF and WHO to guarantee the availability of vaccine emergency stock supplies at the global levels;Follow standard operating procedures and establish financial mechanisms to purchase emergency vaccine supplies and ensure their sustainability."
Who are ICG's partners?,"The ICG is made up of four member agencies:International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) - Has strong country presence for community health promotion, local social and resource mobilization and provides support to states during disasters and
    epidemics.Médecins sans Frontières (MSF) - An independent, field-based NGO that provides health care to vulnerable populations in emergency settings.United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) - Conducts wide scale vaccine procurement and shipment, and provides technical support on campaign planning and implementation in country focusing specially on social mobilization and
    cold chain.World Health Organization (WHO) - Provides global public health advice and technical support to countries. During outbreaks, WHO focuses on vaccine stockpile management, surveillance, preparedness and response to disease outbreaks.Additional expertise and technical advice is provided on a case-by- case basis from partners including: Agence de Médecine Preventive in Paris, Epicentre in Paris, GAVI the Vaccine Alliance, WHO Collaborating Centres, the US Centers for Disease
    Control and the European Community Humanitarian Office (ECHO).Vaccine manufacturers, vaccine equipment providers and financial donor institutions are also engaged in the ICG operations."
Which vaccine stockpiles are available through the ICG?,"CGs have been established to provide access to vaccines for the following diseases:Cholera - Since 2013, the ICG for Cholera manages the global stockpile of oral cholera vaccine which was created as an additional tool to help control cholera epidemics. Since July 2013, the ICG has released more than 5 million doses of oral cholera vaccines to affected countries.Meningitis - The ICG on Vaccine Provision for Epidemic Meningitis Control was established in January 1997, following major outbreaks of meningitis in Africa. Since then, 59 million doses of vaccines were shipped for emergency response in 20 African countries.Yellow fever - Since 2001, 90 million doses of yellow fever vaccine have been released and shipped to countries facing outbreaks. With vaccine manufacturers as partners in the ICG, a stockpile of 6 million doses has been reserved for outbreak response since May 2016."
How does the ICG decide to release emergency vaccine stockpiles?,"Vaccine security stocks can be accessed by ANY country facing an epidemic ANYWHERE in the world, as long as the country’s request fulfills ICG’s criteria for release of vaccine stocks. As a first step, a country must complete and submit a request to the ICG Secretariat using the standard application formThe ICG secretariat at WHO then circulates this request to the partners: UNICEF, Médecins Sans Frontières, the International Federation of the Red Cross, and WHO for review and assessment. Additional requests for information are sent back to the country, if needed. Following a rapid consultation and evaluation process, the decision to release vaccines and other supplies is communicated to the requesting country within 48 hours, once all necessary information has been provided. If approved, UNICEF procures vaccines and injection materials and organizes delivery of vaccines to the country, ideally within 7 days.Requests are evaluated taking into account the epidemiological situation, vaccination strategy, pre-existing stocks in the country and operational aspects of the epidemic response."
1. Can mothers living with HIV breastfeed their children in the same way as mothers without HIV?,"WHO recommends that all mothers living with HIV should receive life-long antiretroviral therapy (ART) to support their health and to ensure the wellbeing of their infants.WHO released guidelines in July 2016 advising that, in countries that have opted to promote and support breastfeeding together with ART, mothers living with HIV who are on ART and adherent to therapy should breastfeed exclusively for the first 6 months, and then add complementary feeding until 12 months of age. Breastfeeding with complementary feeding may continue until 24 months of age or beyond.Previously, WHO advice was to breastfeed for 12 months but then stop breastfeeding if a nutritionally adequate and safe diet could be provided.The new guidance is based on scientific evidence that shows ART is very effective at preventing HIV transmission through breastfeeding as long as the mother is adherent to therapy. The new evidence means that mothers living with HIV and their children can benefit from the many advantages of breastfeeding – such as improved growth and development – in the same way as mothers who do not have HIV and their children. WHO recommendations emphasise the need for health systems to therefore achieve quality HIV services that reliably provide ART and continue to care for mothers living with HIV."
"2. Is mixed feeding better than no breastfeeding at all, if the mother is on HIV treatment?","Yes. Mothers living with HIV can be reassured that ART reduces the risk of post-natal HIV transmission even when the baby is on mixed feeding. Although exclusive breastfeeding is recommended for the first 6 months, mixed feeding is better than no breastfeeding. Encouraging mothers living with HIV to breastfeed exclusively is still strongly advised because it benefits the infant in many ways including, reduced illness, and improved growth and development."
"3. If a mother on HIV treatment plans to return to work or school, is a shorter duration of breastfeeding better than no breastfeeding at all?",Yes. Mothers and health-care workers can be reassured that shorter durations of breastfeeding of less than 12 months are better than never initiating breastfeeding.
4. What can be done to support breastfeeding among mothers living with HIV?,"Governments and local authorities should actively promote and implement services to create a supportive environment for mothers living with HIV to remain adherent to treatment and to breastfeed their infants in all settings: at work, at community centres, in health clinics, and in their homes."
What is health promotion?,"Health promotion enables people to increase control over their 
own health. It covers a wide range of social and environmental 
interventions that are designed to benefit and protect individual 
people’s health and quality of life by addressing  and preventing the 
root causes of ill health, not just focusing on treatment and cure.  
		There are 3 key elements of health promotion:1.	Good governance for healthHealth promotion requires policy makers across all government 
departments to make health a central line of government policy.  This 
means they must factor health implications into all the decisions they 
take, and prioritize policies that prevent people from becoming ill and 
protect them from injuries.  These policies must be supported by regulations that match 
private sector incentives with public health goals. For example, by 
aligning tax policies on unhealthy or harmful products such as alcohol, 
tobacco, and food products which are high in salt, sugars and fat with 
measures to boost trade in other areas. And through legislation that 
supports healthy urbanization by creating walkable cities, reducing air 
and water pollution, enforcing the wearing of seat belts and helmets.  2.	Health literacyPeople need to acquire the knowledge, skills and information 
to make healthy choices, for example about the food they eat and 
healthcare services that they need. They need to have opportunities  to 
make those choices. And they need to be assured of an environment in 
which people can demand further policy actions to further improve their 
health.  3.	Healthy cities Cities have a key role to play in promoting good health. 
Strong leadership and commitment at the municipal level is essential to 
healthy urban planning and to build up preventive measures in 
communities and primary health care facilities.  From healthy cities 
evolve healthy countries and, ultimately, a healthier world."
"Q: We know that the same mosquito species can carry many diseases (such as dengue, Zika, chikungunya, and yellow fever). Can a mosquito carry more than one disease at the same time? If so, could someone get more than one disease from a single bite?","The mosquito species Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus carry dengue, chikungunya and Zika virus. In addition, Aedes aegypti also transmits yellow fever.Studies done in Gabon and India show that humans can be infected with chikungunya and dengue at the same time.Entomological studies confirming coinfection in mosquitoes are rare. The Gabon study found one mosquito specimen that was positive for both viruses, meaning that it is possible that the bite of a single mosquito could infect a person with 2 viruses at the same time.Coinfection poses a challenge for accurate diagnosis and treatment, particularly when symptoms such as fever and aches can be similar for many diseases."
What is XDR-TB?,"XDR-TB, an abbreviation for extensively drug-resistant (XDR) 
tuberculosis (TB), is a form of TB which is resistant to at least 4 of 
the core anti-TB drugs. XDR-TB involves resistance to the 2 most 
powerful anti-TB drugs, isoniazid and rifampicin, also known as 
multidrug-resistance (MDR-TB), in addition to resistance to any of the 
fluoroquinolones (such as levofloxacin or moxifloxacin) and to at least 1
 of 3 injectable second-line drugs (amikacin, capreomycin or kanamycin).MDR-TB and XDR-TB both take substantially longer to treat than
 ordinary (drug-susceptible) TB, and require the use of second-line 
anti-TB drugs, which are more expensive and have more side-effects than 
the first-line drugs used for drug-susceptible TB."
How do people get XDR-TB?,"People may get XDR-TB in 1 of 2 ways. It may develop in a 
patient who is receiving treatment for active TB, when anti-TB drugs are
 misused or mismanaged, and is usually a sign of inadequate clinical 
care or drug management. It can happen when patients are not properly 
supported to complete their full course of treatment; when health-care 
providers prescribe the wrong treatment, or the wrong dose, or for too 
short a period of time; when the supply of drugs to the clinics 
dispensing drugs is erratic; or when the drugs are of poor quality.The second way that people can develop XDR-TB is by becoming 
infected from a patient who is already ill with the condition. Patients 
with TB of the lungs can spread the disease by coughing, sneezing, or 
simply talking. A person needs only to breathe in a small number of 
these germs to become infected. However only a small proportion of 
people infected with TB germs develop the disease. A person can be 
infected by XDR-TB bacteria but not develop the active disease, just as 
with drug-susceptible TB."
How easily is XDR-TB spread?,"Studies suggest that there is probably no difference between 
the risk of transmission of XDR-TB and any other forms of TB. The spread
 of TB bacteria depends on factors such as the number and concentration 
of infectious people in any one place together, and the presence of 
people with a higher risk of being infected (such as those with 
HIV/AIDS).The likelihood of becoming infected increases with the time 
that a previously uninfected person spends in the same room as an 
infectious case. The risk of spread increases where there is a high 
concentration of TB bacteria, such as can occur in poorly-ventilated 
environments like overcrowded houses, hospitals, or prisons. The risk of
 spread is reduced if infectious patients receive timely and proper 
treatment."
How can a person avoid becoming infected with XDR-TB?,"While patients with XDR-TB may be as infectious as those with 
ordinary TB, the chances of a TB infection being XDR-TB is lower due to 
the rarity of the condition. The measures to be taken are the same as 
those for the prevention of ordinary TB.Close contact with a patient with infectious TB is to be 
avoided, especially in poorly ventilated spaces. The risk of becoming 
infected with TB is very low outdoors in the open air. TB patients 
should be encouraged to follow good cough hygiene, for example, covering
 their mouths with a handkerchief when they cough, or even, in the early
 stages of treatment, using a surgical mask, especially when in closed 
environments with poor ventilation."
How can a person who already has ordinary TB avoid getting XDR-TB?,"The most important thing is for the health care workers and 
community to provide all the means (such as information, counselling, 
and material support) that enable patients to continue taking all their 
treatment as prescribed.No doses should be missed and above all, treatment should be 
taken right through to the end. If a patient finds that side-effects are
 a problem – for example, the tablets make them feel sick – then they 
should inform their doctor or nurse, because often there is a simple 
solution. If they need to go away for any reason, patients should make 
sure they have enough tablets with them for the duration of the trip."
Can XDR-TB be cured or treated?,"XDR-TB patients can be cured, but with the current drugs 
available, the likelihood of success is much smaller than in patients 
with ordinary TB or even MDR-TB. Cure depends on the extent of the drug 
resistance, the severity of the disease and whether the patient’s immune
 system is compromised.Patients infected with HIV may have a higher mortality rate. 
Early and accurate diagnosis is important so that effective treatment is
 provided as soon as possible. Effective treatment requires that a good 
selection of second-line drugs is available to clinicians who have 
special expertise in treating such cases."
Why is vaccination important for addressing antibiotic resistance?,"Vaccines can help limit the spread of antibiotic resistance.
		The global increase in disease caused by drug-resistant 
bacteria, due to overuse and misuse of antibiotics, is a major public 
health concern. It is more difficult and costly to treat 
antibiotic-resistant infections and people do not always recover.Vaccinating humans and animals is a very effective way to stop
 them from getting infected and thereby preventing the need for 
antibiotics.
Making better use of existing vaccines and developing new 
vaccines are important ways to tackle antibiotic resistance and reduce 
preventable illness and deaths."
How can existing vaccines have an impact?,"Expanding the use of existing vaccines will reduce the use of antibiotics and the development of resistance.
		For example, if every child in the world received a vaccine to protect them from infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae
 bacteria (which can cause pneumonia, meningitis and middle ear 
infections), this would prevent an estimated 11 million days of 
antibiotic use each year.Vaccines against viruses, such as the flu, also have a role to
 play, because people often take antibiotics unnecessarily when they 
have symptoms such as fever that can be caused by a virus."
How can new vaccines have an impact?,"Developing and using new vaccines to prevent bacterial diseases can further reduce the development of resistance.
		Antibiotics are currently the standard medical intervention for common diseases such as Group A Streptococcus (which causes “strep throat”), for which we do not yet have vaccines.We also need vaccines to stop people from catching diseases 
caused by bacteria that are now frequently antibiotic-resistant. For 
example, there is an alarming spread of multi-drug resistant 
tuberculosis (MDR-TB). In 2015, an estimated 480 000 people were 
infected with MDR-TB.Similarly, new vaccines targeting Staphylococcus aureus (which causes skin and soft tissue infections), Klebsiella pneumoniae (which causes pneumonia and infections of the blood stream and urinary tract), Clostridium difficile
 (which causes diarrhoeal disease), and many others could protect people
 against diseases that are increasingly difficult to treat.Developing new vaccines and getting them used appropriately is
 lengthy and complex. The scientific community needs to prioritise which
 new vaccines would have the greatest impact on antibiotic resistance, 
and promote investment in these."
How common is XDR-TB?,"XDR-TB is rare, however 117 countries worldwide had reported at 
least 1 case by the end of 2015. It is estimated that about 9.5% of 
MDR-TB cases worldwide have XDR-TB. In 2015, there were an estimated 480
 000 new cases of MDR-TB worldwide, and an additional 100 000 people 
with rifampicin-resistant TB were also newly eligible for MDR-TB 
treatment. Of the 580 000 people newly eligible for MDR-TB treatment, 
only 125 000 (20%) were enrolled."
How do countries prevent XDR-TB?,"National TB control programmes working with all health 
services can prevent XDR-TB by ensuring that all practitioners working 
with people with TB adhere to the International Standards for TB Care.These standards emphasize:providing proper diagnosis and treatment to all TB patients, including those with drug-resistant TB;assuring regular, timely supplies of all anti-TB drugs;proper management of anti-TB drugs and providing support to patients to maximize adherence to prescribed regimens;caring for MDR/XDR-TB cases in services with proper ventilation; andminimizing contact with other patients, particularly those with 
HIV, especially in the early stages before treatment has had a chance to
 reduce the infectiousness."
"Can the TB vaccine, known as BCG, prevent XDR-TB?","The BCG vaccine prevents severe forms of TB in children, such as 
TB meningitis, but is less effective in preventing pulmonary TB in 
adults, the most common and most infectious form of TB. It is expected 
that the effectiveness of BCG against XDR-TB is similar as for ordinary 
TB. Nevertheless, new vaccines are urgently needed, and WHO is actively 
advocating for the development of new vaccines."
What is the link between XDR-TB and HIV/AIDS? Why in some places is XDR-TB linked with HIV?,"People living with HIV are at greater risk of developing TB – 
as well as XDR-TB – than people without HIV, because of their weakened 
immunity. In few places where XDR-TB strains circulate more frequently, 
people with HIV are therefore more likely to be infected with XDR-TB 
than elsewhere. To date, in most of the places with high rates of HIV 
infection, XDR-TB has not been widespread.For this reason, the majority of people with HIV who develop 
TB will have ordinary TB and can be treated with standard first-line 
anti-TB drugs. For those with HIV infection, treatment with 
antiretroviral drugs will likely reduce the risk of developing XDR-TB, 
just as it does with ordinary TB. Patients with both XDR-TB and HIV who 
do not receive antiretroviral drugs are at high risk of dying."
How can I tell if I might have TB or XDR-TB?,"XDR-TB can only be diagnosed in a well-equipped laboratory. 
Symptoms of XDR-TB are no different from ordinary TB: a cough with 
thick, cloudy mucus (or sputum), sometimes with blood, for more than 2 
weeks; fever, chills, and night sweats; fatigue and muscle weakness; 
weight loss; and in some cases shortness of breath and chest pain. If 
you have these symptoms, it does not mean you have XDR-TB.But it does mean you must go and see a doctor for a check-up. 
If you are already on treatment for TB, and at least some of these 
symptoms are not improving after a few weeks of medication, you should 
inform your clinician or nurse."
How quickly can XDR-TB be diagnosed?,"If TB bacteria are found in the sputum, the diagnosis of TB can be
 made in a day or two. To confirm XDR-TB, however, it may take from 6 to
 16 weeks."
Is it safe to travel to places where XDR-TB has been identified?,"XDR-TB is still very rare but has been documented in many 
countries. People who are most at risk, if they do come into contact 
with someone with XDR-TB, are those with reduced immunity to infectious 
diseases, such as those with HIV infection or other medical conditions 
that can weaken a person's immunity.It is also advised that such people should avoid areas where 
there are no infection control measures in place. Air travel carries 
only very minimal risks of infection with any kind of TB. Concerned 
travellers should seek advice before their visit from their doctor, 
national authorities, or trusted travel web sites."
What should be done if a person has been in contact with a known or suspected case of XDR-TB?,"Anyone who has been in contact with someone known, or 
suspected of having, XDR-TB should consult their doctor or a local TB 
clinic and be screened to see if they have TB. This is most important if
 the person has any symptoms of TB. If they have a cough, they will be 
asked to provide a sample of sputum, which will be tested for evidence 
of TB disease.If TB is found, treatment will be started with the drugs to 
which the person’s TB is most likely to respond. If there is any 
evidence of infection with TB bacteria but without TB disease, 
preventive treatment may be given or the person may simply be asked to 
attend health services periodically for a check-up."
Should patients with XDR-TB be isolated while on treatment or after treatment options have failed?,"In order to make the diagnosis, patients with suspected TB or 
XDR-TB are sometimes admitted to hospital. In order to protect other 
patients and health workers in the hospital, isolation of such patients 
is part of good quality care. Once the diagnosis is made and treatment 
begun, for patients who are willing to undergo treatment, isolation is 
usually neither necessary nor appropriate.Isolation has a very limited role to play in patients in whom 
treatment has failed. Studies have shown that treating TB patients at 
home with appropriate infection measures in place generally poses no 
substantial risk to other members of the household. By the time a 
diagnosis is made, the household contacts have already been exposed to 
the patient’s infection.However, in the absence of options for curative treatment, all
 infection control measures at household should be strengthened. 
Whenever this is not feasible then options for voluntary isolation and 
delivery of palliative and end of life care should be offered to the 
patient."
"What risks do health-care workers face with XDR-TB, particularly those who may be HIV-positive themselves?","To protect health-care workers who may come into contact with 
infectious TB patients, appropriate and strict infection control 
measures must be implemented in health-care facilities at all times. 
Health-care workers are also encouraged to make sure that they are aware
 of their HIV status so that they can restrict putting themselves at 
risk of exposure."
What is WHO doing to combat XDR-TB?,"Firstly, WHO is ensuring that the health authorities responsible 
for TB care and control receive accurate information about XDR-TB. The 
latest information on XDR-TB, and related TB issues, are published on 
the WHO Global TB Programme website.Secondly, WHO advises that good TB prevention, care and 
control prevents the emergence of drug resistance in the first place, 
and that the proper treatment of MDR-TB prevents the emergence of 
XDR-TB.Thirdly, WHO is regularly updating its guidance to Ministries 
of Health on the management of drug-resistant TB patients and diagnostic
 policies."
Why have some of the key metrics in this year’s report changed from the previous year?,"Last year’s report provided projections for 2015 based on trends up to 2013 and 2014; this year’s report includes the latest data we received from the national malaria programmes and nationally representative household surveys from 2015.Overall, there is a reasonably good match between last year’s projections and this year’s estimates. South-East Asia is the one region where the number of reported cases came in much lower than predictions, which required us to update other
    global statistics in the report."
The report shows that total funding for malaria has flat-lined since 2010. How likely are we to meet the funding levels needed to achieve the 2020 targets of the Global Technical Strategy for Malaria (GTS)?,"The goals set by the GTS are ambitious, and robust funding is necessary to achieve them. Because economic growth has slowed in many of our big donor countries, we will need to diversify our funding sources in order to achieve GTS targets. The development
    of new domestic financing mechanisms would help provide a much-needed increase in contributions from malaria-endemic countries. In addition, we must use the funds we do have more strategically. We must select the most appropriate interventions for individual settings, and we need to target populations that will benefit the most."
"We’ve spent a lot of money fighting malaria, but progress towards some GTS targets is off-track. Please explain.","First, it is important to understand that progress is not always linear; it is normal to see some fluctuations in trends as countries make progress towards elimination. Seeing some increases in malaria case incidence in a given year is part of the overall
    pattern of decline. It is when we see countries having multiple years in a row with increases that we start to be concerned.Progress also varies by country. A good number of malaria-endemic countries are on track to achieve the GTS 2020 milestones. However, many also are not. Progress is slowest in low-income countries with a high malaria burden, weak health systems and poor
    access to interventions. Increased funding and strengthened programmatic efforts are urgently needed to accelerate progress in these countries."
"The report shows that the fewer malaria cases a country has, the higher the per capita spending on control and elimination programmes. Shouldn’t it be the other way around?","In low burden settings, programmatic efforts rely less on the delivery of commodities (which tend to be very cost-effective) and instead focus on activities that require more human resources and more of people’s time. This is particularly true for
    malaria surveillance and case investigation, which requires teams of malaria personnel to investigate individual cases. However, while elimination is expensive in the short-term, the longer-term financial and human benefits of achieving elimination
    in a country outweigh the costs."
"The majority of malaria cases and deaths are concentrated in a number of countries in sub-Saharan Africa, where progress has been slow. What new approaches will be taken to help these countries accelerate progress?","The countries with the highest malaria burden are the countries where progress is most challenging. These countries tend to be very poor and have weak, inaccessible health systems – and, as a consequence, the lowest coverage rates for interventions. We have cost effective tools to prevent and treat malaria; a greater effort is needed to ensure that these tools are made available to those who currently do not have access to them."
Is malaria elimination a realistic goal for high-burden countries?,"Elimination is ultimately the long-term goal for all malaria-endemic countries. But without large increases in funding, innovative new tools, and major improvements in national health systems, it is unlikely that the 13 countries with the highest number
    of malaria cases – Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Cote d’Ivoire, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ghana, India, Kenya, Mali, Mozambique, Niger, Nigeria, Uganda and United Republic of Tanzania – will achieve elimination during the timeframe
    established by the GTS. However, we can still make a lot of progress in these countries with the tools we have now. Many people will benefit from these efforts, even if elimination is not reached in the near-term."
"Why are we seeing a decline in 2015 in the procurement of ACT treatments, a decrease in coverage with IRS, and an expected decline in ITN procurement next year?","Decreases in artemisnin-based combination therapy (ACT) procurements are twofold. First, there are fewer cases of malaria than in previous years, so fewer treatments are needed. Second, increased testing for malaria means that only patients with a positive
    test result are receiving treatment.Decreases in coverage with indoor residual spraying (IRS) of insecticides are occurring as countries change or rotate the insecticides they are using to try to prevent the spread of mosquitoes resistant to pyrethroids – a class of chemicals also
    used in insecticide-treated bednets. As alternative insecticides are more expensive than pyrethroids, increased funding for IRS is needed to maintain high coverage levels.Insecticide-treated bednets (ITNs) can last for three years and are distributed in three year cycles, so we expect to see some fluctuation in numbers year-by-year. The number of ITNs procured this year was slightly lower than in the two preceding years,
    which were the highest on record. However, if we don’t see a subsequent increase in ITN coverage in 2017, then there will be cause for concern."
What are the reasons behind the five-fold increase in the number of women receiving three doses of IPTp?,"It is the result of countries responding effectively to new policy guidance on intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy (IPTp) issued by WHO. WHO updated the recommended dosing – from two to three doses – based on recommendations from
    an evidence review group in 2012."
What is Legionnaires’ disease?,"Legionnaires' disease is caused by exposure to a bacterium 
that is found in water and soil. It ranges in severity from a mild 
influenza-like illness to a serious and sometimes fatal form of 
pneumonia. Symptoms include fever, headache, lethargy, muscle pain, diarrhoea and sometimes coughing up blood.The disease can be treated with antibiotics."
Who is most at risk?,"Most people exposed to the legionella bacterium do not get sick and the disease does not spread directly between humans.Most people who do get sick are aged over 50 years. People 
with weak immune systems, chronic illnesses, smokers and those with a 
history of heavy drinking are at highest risk.Outbreaks are often linked to poorly maintained air conditioning and water systems, humidifiers and whirlpool spas."
Where does the disease occur?,"Legionnaires’ disease occurs worldwide but the rate of 
occurrence is unknown as many countries lack good surveillance systems 
to diagnose and detect the disease.In Australia, Europe and the United States of America, there are about 10-15 cases detected per million population."
How can it be prevented?,"The public health threat of Legionnaires’ disease can be 
reduced by regular maintenance, cleaning and disinfection of water and 
air conditioning systems to minimize the growth of the legionella 
bacterium. There is no vaccine currently available for Legionnaire’s disease.More information:Fact sheet on Legionellosis (updated June 2016)"
What is guinea worm? Is it a real worm?,"Guinea worm is, in fact, a real worm. It is a large nematode, Dracunculus medinensis,
 which is ingested through drinking contaminated water. The condition is
 known as dracunculiasis or guinea-worm disease. The worm eventually 
causes a debilitating and painful infection that begins with a blister, 
normally on the leg. Around the time of its eruption, the person may 
experience itching, fever, swelling, severe pain and a burning 
sensation. 
		Infected people often try to relieve the pain by immersing the
 infected part in water. If it is immersed in open water sources such as
 ponds and shallow step wells the worm emerges and releases thousands of
 larvae. The larva is ingested by a water flea (cyclop), where it 
develops and becomes infective in two weeks. When a person drinks the 
water, the cyclop is killed by the acidity of the stomach and the larva 
is freed and penetrates the gut wall. After about one year, a blister 
forms and the mature worm, one metre long, emerges thus repeating the 
life-cycle.At the beginning of the 20th century, guinea-worm disease was 
widespread in many countries in Africa and Asia. Out of 20 countries 
that were endemic worldwide in the early 1980s, only Chad, Ethiopia, and
 South Sudan – all from the African continent – are currently endemic. 
In 2015, only 251 cases were reported to WHO."
Why has WHO launched a new framework for malaria elimination?,"The malaria landscape has changed significantly since the first framework for malaria elimination was released in 2007. Over the last 10 years, funding has increased, access to core malaria interventions has improved, new tools and strategies have been developed, and the malaria burden has dramatically decreased, putting more countries on the path to elimination.In May 2015, the World Health Assembly adopted a new Global Technical Strategy for Malaria 2016–2030, a landmark document that sets ambitious new goals for the malaria community. All of these advances have led to new global guidance and policy recommendations by WHO, which are reflected in the new WHO Framework for malaria elimination."
What are some of the key changes in the new framework?,"2007 framework was intended for countries with low to moderate malaria transmission, and provided guidance for countries to assess whether or not malaria elimination was a feasible goal. But this concept of feasibility created a dichotomy that is no longer seen as useful: we think that every country can achieve elimination.While it is true that elimination is a longer-term goal for countries with a high malaria burden, it is still the ultimate end goal. Instead of asking if a country can achieve elimination, the new framework outlines the critical requirements needed to achieve and maintain elimination at every level of malaria transmission intensity in every endemic country."
Where does yellow fever occur?,"Yellow fever occurs in 47 endemic countries in Africa in Central and South America. Around 90% of cases reported every year occur in Sub-Saharan Africa.Infected travellers from areas where yellow fever occurs can export cases to countries that are free of yellow fever, but the disease can only spread easily if that country has the mosquito species able to transmit it, specific climatic conditions and the animal reservoir needed to maintain it."
How do you get yellow fever?,"The yellow fever virus is transmitted by infected mosquitoes, most commonly from the Aedes species – the same mosquito that spreads the Zika, Chikungunya and Dengue virus. Haemogogus mosquitoes also spread yellow fever and are mostly found in the jungle. Mosquitoes become infected with the virus when they bite an infected human or monkey. The disease cannot be spread by contact from one person to another.Mosquitoes breed in tropical rainforests, humid, and semi-humid environments, as well as around bodies of still water in and close to human habitations in urban settings. Increased contact between humans and infected mosquitoes, particularly in urban areas where people have not been vaccinated for yellow fever, can create epidemics.Outbreaks of the disease are of particular concern when they occur in overcrowded settings with inadequate water supply and waste management services that allow the mosquitoes to breed easily."
What are the symptoms?,"Once contracted, the yellow fever virus incubates in the body for 3 to 6 days. Symptoms usually present themselves in 2 phases.The first, ""acute"", phase usually causes fever, muscle pain with prominent backache, headache, shivers, loss of appetite, and nausea or vomiting. Most patients improve and their symptoms disappear after 3 to 4 days.However, a small percentage of people enter a second, more toxic phase within 24 hours of the initial remission. They will experience high fever, jaundice, and abdominal pain with vomiting and deteriorating kidney function. Bleeding can occur from the mouth, nose, eyes or stomach, with blood appearing in vomit and faeces. Half of the patients who enter the toxic phase die within 10 to 14 days, the rest recover without significant organ damage."
The new framework uses a malaria transmission continuum to guide programmatic decision-making. Can you explain how this works?,"Malaria transmission can vary widely within a country. To be effective, programmes must select strategies and tools that are appropriate for the malaria situation in a targeted geographic area. The new framework facilitates this planning by identifying recommended programmatic actions along the continuum of malaria transmission, from high transmission to very low.Areas with high malaria transmission intensity, for example, should focus on scaling up vector control and universal access to diagnosis and treatment, while strengthening surveillance systems as they go. In areas where transmission is very low, elimination activities can be accelerated and additional new methods can be applied. When an area is very close to having zero malaria cases, any cases that do occur should be investigated to clear remaining areas of infection."
What else is new?,"Our framework is now aligned with the three pillars of the Global Technical Strategy for Malaria 2016–2030: ensuring universal access to malaria prevention, diagnosis and treatment; accelerating efforts towards elimination and attainment of malaria-free status; and transforming malaria surveillance into a core intervention. Surveillance in particular plays a key role in the fight against malaria, and this is highlighted throughout the document. Elimination cannot be achieved without quality surveillance systems.Other updates include an overview of the requirements for achieving and maintaining elimination, such as national surveillance systems, quality data management, and robust human and financial resources."
Can you talk a little bit about changes to the process for WHO certification of malaria elimination?,"There is a new, streamlined process for WHO certification of malaria elimination, which occurs after a country has had three years without a locally transmitted case of malaria. We’ve also introduced the concept of subnational elimination, which is particularly relevant for large countries like China, Mexico, and Brazil. The framework offers guidance on setting targets and systems to verify malaria-free areas within a country’s borders, which can be an important building block for future national certification. This will help countries document and motivate progress."
Who is this framework intended for?,"This framework is primarily intended for malaria programme managers to inform the development of national strategic plans for malaria elimination. It’s important to mention that this is a framework, not a prescriptive document. The recommended actions and interventions can and should be adapted according to national and sub-national needs."
What has changed in the world since the first framework was issued in 2007?,"Several countries and regions have eliminated malaria, including Sri Lanka, Maldives, Kyrgyzstan, and the European region. WHO has now recognized an additional 21 countries that are on track to reduce malaria transmission to zero by 2020, and is supporting these countries to reach this target. Even high burden countries have started thinking about elimination. It’s a good trend, and helps put us on the right track to achieving global elimination of the disease."
How is it treated?,"There is no specific treatment for yellow fever but good supportive treatment of symptoms, such as dehydration, fever and infection, improves survival rates. Associated bacterial infections can be treated with antibiotics. Yellow fever can be prevented by an extremely effective vaccine that is protective for life."
How is it diagnosed?,"Yellow fever is difficult to diagnose (especially during the early stages) because its symptoms can be confused with other common diseases such as malaria, dengue, leptospirosis and Zika virus, as well as with poisoning. Doctors or clinicians who see a sick patient may not be able to tell that they have yellow fever from their symptoms alone, especially if they are in an area where many of these diseases are occurring at the same time.To confirm a suspected diagnosis of yellow fever, laboratory tests need to be done. Blood tests can detect antibodies produced in response to yellow fever, proving that the person has been infected or vaccinated. Several other techniques are used to identify the virus in blood specimens or liver tissue collected after death. These tests require highly trained laboratory staff and specialized equipment and materials."
How can it be prevented?,"Vaccine is the most important means to combat yellow fever. The yellow fever vaccine is safe and affordable, and a single dose provides life-long immunity against the disease. To prevent outbreaks in affected regions, vaccination coverage must reach at least 80% of the population at risk.Mosquito control can also help to prevent yellow fever, and is vital in situations where vaccination coverage is low or the vaccine is not immediately available. Mosquito control includes eliminating sites where mosquitoes can breed, and killing adult mosquitoes and larvae by using insecticides in areas with high mosquito density. Community involvement through activities such as cleaning household drains and covering water containers where mosquitoes can breed is a very important and effective way to control mosquitoes."
Is the vaccine effective and safe?,"Vaccination is the single most important measure for preventing yellow fever. The vaccine has been used for many decades and is safe and affordable, providing effective immunity against yellow fever within 10 days for more than 90% of people vaccinated and within 30 days for 99% of people vaccinated. A single dose provides lifelong protection and costs less than US$ 2.Side effects of the yellow fever vaccine are generally mild and may include headaches, muscle aches, and low-grade fevers. There have been rare reports of serious side-effects."
Who should be vaccinated?,"In countries where yellow fever occurs, WHO strongly recommends routine vaccination for everyone older than 9 months. During an epidemic, when a mass vaccination campaign is underway, the vaccine is given to everyone over the age of 6 months (when the risk of disease is higher than an adverse event from the vaccine).WHO recommends vaccination for all travellers (with few exceptions) visiting areas where there is risk of yellow fever. Travellers, who have medical grounds for not being vaccinated, must have those grounds certified by the appropriate authorities.Many countries require proof of vaccination against yellow fever before they will issue a visa, particularly if travellers come from or have visited a country where yellow fever occurs. Make sure to keep your yellow fever proof of vaccination safe and bring it with you when you travel to another country.Map: Yellow fever vaccination requirements"
Who should not be vaccinated?,"Some people should not be routinely vaccinated, including:infants aged less than 9 months (or less than 6 months during an outbreak, where the risk of disease is higher than an adverse event from the vaccine)pregnant women (unless during an outbreak)people with severe allergies to egg protein; andpeople with severe immunodeficiency"
Am I protected from yellow fever immediately following vaccination?,"In general, it takes 10 to 14 days from the date of vaccination for a person to develop immunity to the yellow fever virus. Additional personal protection measures from mosquitoes are critically important during this 10-14 day period in yellow fever endemic areas. These include wearing protective clothing, sleeping under insecticide treated bed nets even during the day and using recommended repellents. The vaccination certificate for yellow fever is valid from 10 days after administration of the vaccine for recipients."
Is eradication of yellow fever possible?,Eradication of yellow fever is not feasible since we are unable to control the virus in the natural animal hosts.
Who manages the vaccine supply for yellow fever outbreaks?,In an emergency situation it is often difficult to get enough vaccine doses to protect the entire population at risk due to the limited global vaccine supply. The emergency stockpile is managed by the International Coordinating Group on Vaccine Provision for Yellow Fever Control which was created in 2001. The role of the ICG is to verify that eligibility criteria are met by countries applying for outbreak support from the stockpile and to decide on the amount of vaccine to be shipped.International Coordinating Group (ICG) on Vaccine Provision
How do people catch Zika virus?,"Zika virus is primarily transmitted to people through the bite of an infected Aedes mosquito, which can also transmit chikungunya, dengue and yellow fever.Zika virus can also be transmitted through sex and has been detected in semen, blood, urine, amniotic fluids, saliva as well as body fluids found in the brain and spinal cord.Zika virus may present a risk to blood safety. People who have donated blood are encouraged to report to the blood transfusion service if they subsequently get symptoms of Zika virus infection, or if they are diagnosed with recent Zika virus infection within 14 days after blood donation.Fact sheet on Zika virusMaintaining a safe and adequate blood supply during Zika virus outbreaks"
What are the symptoms of Zika virus disease?,"Zika virus usually causes mild illness. Symptoms most commonly include a slight fever or rash, appearing a few days after a person is bitten by an infected mosquito. Although many will not develop any symptoms at all, others may also suffer from conjunctivitis, muscle and joint pain, and feel tired. The symptoms usually last from 2 to 7 days.There is no known difference in the symptoms of infected pregnant and non-pregnant women.Interim case definition of Zika virus disease"
How is Zika virus disease diagnosed?,"Diagnosis is based on symptoms and the person’s recent history (e.g. mosquito bites, or travel to an area where Zika virus occurs). Laboratory testing can confirm the presence of Zika virus in the blood. However, this diagnosis may not be reliable as the virus could cross-react with other viruses such as dengue, West Nile and yellow fever. The development of a reliable, rapid point-of-care diagnostic test is high priority for Zika-related research.Surveillance for Zika virus infection, microcephaly and Guillain-Barré syndromeLaboratory testing for Zika virus infection"
How would you define vector control?,"In global health, a vector is any organism that is a vehicle for disease transmission. We use the term vector control to refer to the different methods used to prevent the vector from transmitting a disease. In the case of the malaria parasite, the vector is the female Anopheles mosquito.Soon after a female mosquito hatches, she will go out looking for a blood meal to give her energy and the nutrition she needs to produce her eggs (males do not feed on blood but instead obtain the energy they need from plant nectar). If a female mosquito bites a person infected with malaria, she will pick up the parasites. However, she won’t be able to pass on the parasites to another person until the parasites have matured inside her – a process that takes about 10 days. This gives us a window of opportunity to effectively kill the mosquito vector before she can infect someone else."
What are the most powerful vector control tools currently in use?,"In short, to prevent malaria we essentially try to do 3 things: stop mosquitoes from getting infected, prevent them from surviving long enough to pass on the infection, and prevent people from getting infected. Two of the most effective tools we have to fight malaria are insecticide-treated mosquito nets (ITNs) and indoor residual spraying of insecticides (IRS).The idea behind IRS is to apply insecticides to the inside walls of homes. These insecticides will kill mosquitoes when they rest on the walls after biting someone. IRS works really well and has been around for a long time, but it is logistically more difficult to implement than ITNs. Anyone who has had the experience of walking around in protective gear on a hot day with a heavy spray-tank of insecticide on their back will appreciate the effort it takes to do this year after year.Depending on the length of an area’s malaria transmission season and the insecticide formulation being used, an area at risk of malaria transmission will need to be sprayed once or even twice a year for malaria to effectively be controlled. And a high percentage of houses in a community need to be sprayed to get the effect you want – to ultimately reduce the lifespan of mosquitoes so they die before they can transmit the disease. So while it’s very effective, some of the practicalities are challenging and that’s part of the reason why ITNs were developed.ITNs are incredibly effective and have had a huge impact over the years. ITNs alone were responsible for 69% of all of the malaria cases averted by interventions in Africa since 2001. They must be distributed along with health education, to help people understand how to use and care for them."
What is the role of the Global Malaria Programme’s Entomology & Vector Control unit?,"The ultimate goal is simply for everyone living in malaria endemic countries to have access to these tools and, in the case of ITNs, to be using them every night. But we’re not there yet. We’ve made massive progress, but there continues to be significant gaps in coverage. Addressing these gaps will be critical to achieving successful control and, ultimately, malaria elimination. Of course, increased funding will be critical for improving coverage – obviously you need to have enough money to buy the tools and deliver them to communities. But we also need to be continually refining and improving our strategies.The malaria community has been very effective in getting our core vector control tools into communities very quickly through mass distribution or large spray campaigns. But we know, for example, that system inefficiencies increase as coverage goes up. From survey data, you can see that some individuals are consistently missed by mass campaigns, while others have more than sufficient nets to cover the household. So one thing we need to work on is improving our understanding of where coverage gaps lie and how they are being created, to work out better ways of getting interventions to all those who need them."
Are there improvements you’d like to see with existing vector control tools?,"There is research ongoing to make the tools we have more effective and longer lasting. I’d like to see long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) become more durable. LLINs are treated with insecticides that can be effective for up to 3 years, but the nets can often tear and develop holes that make them become unusable before those 3 years are up. I think there is also some room to make the residual effect of IRS last longer, so that we do not have to spray as frequently.Finally, we’ve been very successful at targeting mosquitoes that bite indoors with these interventions to date, but we know that malaria transmission continues to occur in certain areas. I think that, going forward, we will need to focus on developing ways to control malaria vectors that tend to bite and rest outdoors."
Who manages the yellow fever vaccine supply for routine immunization and preventive mass campaign?,"WHO and UNICEF have the oversight role in tracking and supplying yellow fever vaccine for routine immunization. The YF Initiative (YFI) led by WHO and UNICEF coordinates yellow fever control at the global level. The goals of the Initiative are to prevent yellow fever outbreaks and to secure the supply of yellow fever vaccines. The Yellow Fever Initiative monitors the yellow fever activities at global level and identifies priorities in routine immunization, preventive campaigns, and outbreaks, including yellow fever vaccine supply issues.Read the Q&A on yellow fever in Angola"
How is Zika virus disease treated?,"The symptoms of Zika virus disease can be treated with common pain and fever medicines, rest and plenty of water. If symptoms worsen, people should seek medical advice."
Why do we need a Zika virus country classification scheme?,Public health agencies like WHO classify countries to characterize the level of Zika virus transmission in a given time and the potential for its spread. This information enables countries to prepare and respond to the threat and adapt public health recommendations for residents and travellers.
Why does the scheme only take into consideration the presence in a country of the Aedes aegypti mosquito and not of other mosquitoes?,"The Aedes aegypti mosquito is considered the main vector of Zika virus transmission because it sustains most Zika virus outbreaks. Zika virus may be imported by infected travellers into an area that may not have Zika virus transmission at that point of time. If those travellers are bitten by local Aedes aegypti mosquitoes the mosquitoes can transmit the virus to others, potentially setting off a cycle of transmission. Studies on the role of other species of mosquitoes in human transmission are inconclusive so far."
What are the categories in the Zika virus country classification scheme?,"Category 1: Area with new introduction of Zika virus since 2015 or area where the virus has been re-introduced, with ongoing transmission.Category 2: Area either with evidence of Zika virus circulation before 2015 or with transmission but the area does not satisfy the criteria for 1 or 3. Areas in category 2 may also experience an outbreak of Zika.Category 3: Area with interrupted transmission but with potential for future transmission.Category 4: Area with established Aedes aegypti mosquitoes but no known documented past or current transmission."
What are the public health implications of this classification?,"WHO strongly encourages all countries with Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, whether they ever had Zika virus transmission or not, to enhance early warning systems for Zika and related severe neurological complications. Zika virus infection is usually benign. However, studies have shown that Zika virus is a cause of congenital Zika virus syndrome, a condition occurring in newborns and infants who were exposed to Zika virus before birth. To prevent congenital Zika virus syndrome, it is important to monitor trends in Zika virus infection. WHO has issued a range of guidelines to help countries prepare and respond to outbreaks of Zika virus and related complications.Publications and technical guidance on Zika virus"
How was the Zika virus country classification scheme developed?,"WHO, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) have collaboratively reviewed surveillance data from countries and defined levels of Zika virus transmission and risk based on current evidence. As a guidance development group, they have developed the interim guidance on Zika virus country classification scheme.Zika virus country classification scheme"
What is microcephaly?,"Microcephaly is a condition where a baby’s head is smaller than those of other babies of the same age and sex. Microcephaly happens when there is either a problem in utero, causing the baby’s brain to stop growing properly, or after birth when the head stops growing properly. Children born with microcephaly often have developmental challenges as they grow older. In some cases, children with microcephaly develop entirely normally. Microcephaly can be caused by a variety of environmental and genetic factors such as Down syndrome; exposure to drugs, alcohol or other toxins in the womb; and rubella infection during pregnancy.Fact sheet on microcephalySurveillance for Zika virus infection, microcephaly and Guillain-Barré syndromeScreening, assessment and management of neonates and infants with complications associated with Zika virus exposure in utero"
What is congenital Zika virus syndrome?,"In addition to congenital microcephaly, a range of manifestations has been reported among babies up to 4 weeks old where there has been exposure to Zika virus in utero. These include malformations of the head, involuntary movement, seizures, irritability, brainstem dysfunction such as swallowing problems, limb contractures, hearing and sight abnormalities and brain anomalies. Other outcomes associated with Zika virus infection in utero may involve miscarriages and stillbirths. Together, the spectrum of congenital abnormalities associated with Zika virus exposure of fetuses during pregnancy are known as “congenital Zika virus syndrome.”Not all children with congenital Zika virus syndrome present with microcephaly. On the other hand, failure to observe signs of congenital Zika virus syndrome, particularly when assessed in utero, does not necessarily mean that the fetus or newborn does not have abnormalities. For example, hearing abnormalities may not be assessed in utero but only after birth. Some signs such as seizures may develop only after birth.Screening, assessment and management of neonates and infants with complications associated with Zika virus exposure in utero"
What is Guillain-Barré syndrome?,"Guillain-Barré syndrome is a rare condition in which a person’s immune system attacks his or her nerves. People of all ages can be affected, but it is more common in adult men. Most people recover fully from even the most severe cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome. In 20%-30% of people with the condition, the chest muscles are affected, making it hard to breathe. Severe cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome are rare, but can result in near-total paralysis and/or death.Fact sheet on Guillain-Barré syndromeIdentification and management of Guillain-Barré syndrome in the context of Zika virusSurveillance for Zika virus infection, microcephaly and Guillain-Barré syndrome"
What is a Phase 3 clinical trial?,"Clinical trials are a critical source of data for decisions around the development of vaccines, drugs and other medical interventions. They are carried out in several phases.Phase 1: Researchers test a new intervention in a small group of people for the first time to evaluate its safety, determine a safe dosage range, and identify side effects.Phase 2: The intervention is given to a larger group of people to see if it is effective, to further evaluate its safety and eventually to select optimal dosages.Phase 3: The intervention is given to larger numbers of the target group of people to confirm it works (i.e. the efficacy of the intervention), monitor side effects, compare it to commonly used treatments, and collect information that will allow the drug or treatment to be used safely.Phase 4: Studies are done after the intervention has been marketed to gather information on the drug's effectiveness in various populations and any side effects associated with long-term use."
"Where was the Phase 3 clinical trial for RTS,S conducted?","The Phase 3 trial of RTS,S/AS01 (RTS,S) was conducted over 5 years (2009–2014) in 7 sub-Saharan African countries: Burkina Faso, Gabon, Ghana, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique and the United Republic of Tanzania. The trial sites within these countries represented a range of malaria transmission settings (low, medium and high)."
Who were the target age groups?,"The Phase 3 trial enrolled approximately 15 500 infants and young children. There were 2 target age groups:Older children received their first dose of the malaria vaccine between 5 and 17 months of age.Infants received the vaccine together with other routine childhood vaccines at 6, 10 and 14 weeks of age."
What were the vaccine efficacy trial results?,"Children aged 5–17 monthsAmong children aged 5–17 months who received three doses of RTS,S administered at 1-month intervals, followed by a fourth dose 18 months later, the vaccine reduced malaria by 39%, equivalent to preventing nearly 4 in 10 malaria cases. In addition, the 4-dose vaccine schedule reduced severe malaria by 31.5% in this age group, with reductions also seen in malaria hospitalizations, all-cause hospitalizations and the need for blood transfusions. Among children aged 5–17 months who did not receive a fourth dose of the vaccine, the protective benefit against severe malaria was lost, highlighting the importance of the fourth dose of this vaccine to maximise its benefits.InfantsAmong the younger infants, the malaria vaccine did not work sufficiently well to justify its further use in this age group."
What is the fractional dose of the yellow fever vaccine?,"Experts advise that a smaller dose of the vaccine can protect people from yellow fever. Studies show that the yellow fever vaccine given as one fifth of the regular dose, still provides full immunity against the disease for at least 12 months and likely longer.Fractional dosing, or dose sparing, could be used to control an outbreak in cases where the vaccine supply is limited.Fractional dose yellow fever vaccine as a dose-sparing option for outbreak responseMore Q&A's on yellow fever"
What are vaccine experts saying about fractional dosing?,"After reviewing evidence, WHOꞌs Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on Immunization, determined that a fifth of a standard vaccine dose can provide full protection against the disease for at least 12 months and can be used to control outbreaks.In a mass vaccination campaign in Democratic Republic of the Congo in 2016 the fractional dosing method was shown to be feasible and a promising approach to protect at-risk populations that would otherwise be left unprotected.Fractional dosing is not proposed for routine immunization, as there is not enough data available to show that lower doses confer life-long protection. Studies are ongoing to determine the long-term protection provided by fractionated doses.Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization - yellow fever page 21"
What is the relationship between Zika and microcephaly and Guillain-Barré syndrome?,"Based on a newly published systematic review of current research, WHO has reaffirmed its position that Zika virus infection during pregnancy is a cause of congenital brain abnormalities, including microcephaly, and refined its position on the relationship between Zika virus infection and Guillain-Barré syndrome, stating that Zika virus infection is a trigger of Guillain-Barré syndrome.Zika causality statement"
What events led WHO to investigate a causal link between Zika virus and complications including microcephaly and Guillian-Barré syndrome?,"A Zika outbreak in Brazil, identified in early 2015, was followed by an unusual increase in microcephaly among newborns, as well as an increased number of cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome. Zika virus outbreaks rapidly affected other countries and territories in the Americas. The scientific community responded with urgency to the rapidly evolving situation and began building a knowledge base about the virus and its implications extremely quickly.In 2013-2014, Zika virus had caused an outbreak in French Polynesia with some 28 000 people infected with Zika, including cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome. The outbreaks in the Americas led to a reinvestigation of the 2013-14 outbreak in French Polynesia. Looking back, this outbreak appears to have been linked also to microcephaly.Research into the geographical spread of Zika virus and related complications continues."
Are there other explanations for microcephaly and Guillain-Barré syndrome?,"Guillain-Barré syndrome and microcephaly are conditions with a number of underlying causes, triggers and neurological effects. Microcephaly can result, among others, from infections during pregnancy, exposure to toxic chemicals and genetic abnormalities.Guillain-Barré syndrome is often preceded by an infection. This could be a bacterial or viral infection. The syndrome may also be triggered by vaccine administration or surgery.Scientists do not exclude the possibility that other factors may combine with Zika virus infection to cause neurological disorders. A better understanding of Zika virus infection and its complications is one of the remaining research priorities.WHO Zika Virus Research AgendaR&D Blueprint for action to Prevent Epidemics"
Where does Zika virus occur?,"Local transmission of Zika virus by Aedes mosquitoes has been reported on the continents of Africa, the Americas, South-East Asia and the Western Pacific.There are 2 types of Aedes mosquito known to be capable of transmitting Zika virus. In most cases, Zika is spread through the Aedes aegypti mosquito in tropical and subtropical regions. The Aedes albopictus mosquito can also transmit the virus and can hibernate to survive regions with cooler temperatures. Both species breed and live near or inside human dwellings, preferring to bite humans over other animal hosts.A study, conducted by Fiocruz Pernambuco, detected the presence of Zika virus in Culex quinquefasciatus mosquitoes. Recent laboratory studies have shown that Culex species were unable to transmit Zika virus in an experimental setting. It is unlikely that they play a role in the current outbreak of Zika.Mosquito-borne diseasesA review of Zika vectors - Aedes"
Can the Aedes mosquito travel from country to country and region to region?,The Aedes mosquito is a weak flyer; it cannot fly more than 400 meters. However it may be possible for the mosquito to be transported from one place to another accidentally and introduce Zika virus to new areas.WHO Ad-hoc Advisory Group on aircraft disinsection for controlling the international spread of vector-borne diseases
What role does mosquito surveillance play in addressing Zika virus?,"Monitoring the numbers and the geographical distribution of mosquitoes over time (surveillance) helps to make timely decisions about how best to manage mosquito populations.Surveillance can serve to identify areas where a high-density infestation of mosquitoes has occurred or periods when mosquito populations increase. In areas where the mosquitoes are no longer present, mosquito surveillance is critical to detect new introductions rapidly before they become widespread and difficult to eliminate.Monitoring of the mosquito population’s susceptibility to insecticide should also be an integral part of any programme that uses insecticides which are substances to kill insects. Surveillance is a critical component of prevention and control programmes as it provides the information necessary for risk assessment, epidemic response and programme evaluation.Entomological surveillance for Aedes spp. in the context of Zika virus: Interim guidance for entomologistsMonitoring and managing insecticide resistance in Aedes mosquito populations"
What role does mosquito control play in addressing Zika virus?,"Mosquito control is an important component of the prevention and management of Zika virus and complications. WHO encourages affected countries and their partners to scale up the use of current mosquito control interventions as the most immediate line of defence. WHO recommends approaches that tackle all life stages of the Aedes mosquito, from the egg, to the larva/pupa to the adult.Current interventions include: targeted residual spraying of adult Aedes mosquitoes in and around houses; space spraying/indoor fogging where Aedes mosquitoes rest and bite and outside; elimination of Aedes mosquito larvae in standing water breeding sites and personal protection from mosquito bites. If current methods are implemented in an expedient, comprehensive and sustained way, with community participation, along with other measures, mosquito control can be effective. In addition, WHO encourages countries and their partners to judiciously test new control tools that could potentially be applied in the future.WHO's vector control recommendations targeting the Aedes species are also very efficient against other mosquito vectors. The range of methods for reducing mosquitos include spraying the inside walls of houses, indoor space spraying, larval control and eliminating breeding sites. Mosquito control is recommended along with personal protection steps such as the use of insect repellents, bed nets during the day and at night, window and door netting and wire mesh screens.Dispelling rumours around Zika and complicationsProtecting the health and safety of workers in emergency vector control of Aedes mosquitoesVector control operations framework for Zika virus"
What can people do to protect themselves from mosquito bites?,"The best protection from Zika virus and associated complications is preventing mosquito bites. This can be done by:• Wearing clothes (preferably light-coloured) that cover as much of the body as possible.• Using repellents that contain DEET (diethyltoluamide), IR 3535 ((3- [N-butyl-N-acetyl], aminopropionic acid ethyl-ester) or KBR3023 (also called Icaridin or Picaridin). These are applied to exposed skin or to clothing and should be used in strict accordance with the label instructions, especially regarding the duration of protection and timing of re-application. If repellents and sunscreen are used together, sunscreen should be applied first and the repellent thereafter. Using physical barriers such mesh screens or treated netting materials on doors and windows.• Sleeping under mosquito nets day and night.• Identifying and eliminating potential mosquito breeding sites, by emptying, cleaning or covering containers that can hold even small amounts of water, such as buckets, flower pots and tyres.• National programmes can target polluted water bodies and sewage wastes (septic tank outlets need to be covered) with water and sanitation interventions."
Why did vaccine efficacy vary between the 2 target age groups?,"Lower immune responses are induced by the RTS,S vaccine in infants aged 6–12 weeks compared to children aged 5–17 months. Possible factors underlying this difference include interference by co-administration with DTP-containing vaccines, the presence of maternally acquired antibodies to malaria in this age group, and immaturity of the immune system in the 6–12 week olds compared to the 5–17 month age group."
What were the safety results for the vaccine?,"In the Phase 3 trial, the vaccine was generally well tolerated, with adverse reactions similar to those of other childhood vaccines. Among children in the older age group, there was an increased risk of febrile seizures within 7 days after any of the vaccine doses. Among the younger infants, this risk was only apparent after the fourth dose. There were no long-lasting consequences due to any of the febrile seizures.Among children in the older age group, a modest increase in the number of cases of meningitis and cerebral malaria was found in the group receiving the malaria vaccine compared to the control group. It is unclear whether there is a causal link between these findings and the RTS,S vaccinations; this will be further monitored in the pilot implementation programme. This observation was not seen in infants aged 6–12 weeks.The European Medicines Agency found RTS,S to have an acceptable safety profile. As with other new vaccines, and in line with national regulations, the safety profile of RTS,S will continue to be monitored as the vaccine is made available."
What is an EMA scientific opinion based on Article 58?,"The European Medicines Agency (EMA) provides a regulatory procedure (Article 58) to assess the quality, safety and efficacy of a medicine or vaccine that is intended for use only outside the European Union (EU) and to issue a scientific opinion on the benefit-risk ratio of the product. The assessment uses the same standards and procedures as for medicines marketed in the EU. National regulators may use the EMA’s scientific opinion to support their own regulatory review to reach a decision on licensure."
"What is the EMA scientific opinion on RTS,S?","In July 2015, the EMA issued a “European scientific opinion” on RTS,S. The opinion indicated that, in EMA’s assessment, the quality of the vaccine and its risk-benefit profile was favorable from a regulatory perspective. EMA’s opinion did not consider contextual elements such as the feasibility of implementation, the value of the vaccine in the context of other malaria control measures, and the likely cost-effectiveness of the intervention in different settings. RTS,S is expected to be approved for use in the context of the pilots by the National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs) in each of the three countries participating in the Malaria Vaccine Implementation Programme."
"What are the WHO recommendations related to RTS,S?","In October 2015, WHO jointly convened the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on Immunization and the Malaria Policy Advisory Committee (MPAC) to review all evidence regarding RTS,S relevant for global policy. SAGE/MPAC recommended that pilot implementation of RTS,S occur in 3–5 settings in sub-Saharan Africa, administering 3 doses of the vaccine to children beginning as close to 5 months of age as possible and a fourth dose 15–18 months after the third dose. SAGE and MPAC were not supportive of vaccine use among infants aged 6–12 weeks due to the lower efficacy seen in this age group.SAGE/MPAC recommended large-scale implementation pilots, to evaluate the extent to which the protection demonstrated in children aged 5–17 months in the Phase 3 trial can be replicated in the context of the routine health system, particularly in view of the need for a 4-dose schedule that requires new immunization contacts.The pilot implementation should also assess the extent to which RTS,S vaccination impacts mortality, which could not be adequately assessed in the Phase 3 trial due to the very low overall mortality in the trial setting, and whether the excess cases of meningitis and cerebral malaria, identified during the Phase 3 trial, are causally related to RTS,S vaccination or not. The pilot implementation programme will generate critical evidence in 3–5 years’ time to enable decision-making about the potential wider scale use of this vaccine.WHO officially adopted the SAGE/MPAC recommendations in January 2016 and is strongly supportive of the need to proceed with these pilots as the next step for the RTS,S malaria vaccine.WHO position paper on malaria vaccinepdf, 536kb"
What is vaccine-derived polio?,"Oral polio vaccine (OPV) contains an attenuated (weakened) 
vaccine-virus, activating an immune response in the body. When a child 
is immunized with OPV, the weakened vaccine-virus replicates in the 
intestine for a limited period, thereby developing immunity by building 
up antibodies. During this time, the vaccine-virus is also excreted. In 
areas of inadequate sanitation, this excreted vaccine-virus can spread 
in the immediate community (and this can offer protection to other 
children through ‘passive’ immunization), before eventually dying out.  
		On rare occasions, if a population is seriously 
under-immunized, an excreted vaccine-virus can continue to circulate for
 an extended period of time. The longer it is allowed to survive, the 
more genetic changes it undergoes. In very rare instances, the 
vaccine-virus can genetically change into a form that can paralyse – 
this is what is known as a circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus 
(cVDPV).It takes a long time for a cVDPV to occur. Generally, the 
strain will have been allowed to circulate in an un- or under-immunized 
population for a period of at least 12 months. Circulating VDPVs occur 
when routine or supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) are poorly 
conducted and a population is left susceptible to poliovirus, whether 
from vaccine-derived or wild poliovirus. Hence, the problem is not with 
the vaccine itself, but low vaccination coverage. If a population is 
fully immunized, they will be protected against both vaccine-derived and
 wild polioviruses.Since 2000, more than 10 billion doses of OPV have been 
administered to nearly 3 billion children worldwide. As a result, more 
than 13 million cases of polio have been prevented, and the disease has 
been reduced by more than 99%. During that time, 24 cVDPV outbreaks 
occurred in 21 countries, resulting in fewer than 760 VDPV cases.Until 2015, over 90% of cVDPV cases were due to the type 2 
component in OPV. With the transmission of wild poliovirus type 2 
already successfully interrupted since 1999, in April 2016 a switch was 
implemented from trivalent OPV to bivalent OPV in routine immunization 
programmes. The removal of the type 2 component of OPV is associated 
with significant public health benefits, including a reduction of the 
risk of cases of cVDPV2. The small risk of cVDPVs pales in significance to the 
tremendous public health benefits associated with OPV. Every year, 
hundreds of thousands of cases due to wild polio virus are prevented. 
Well over 10 million cases have been averted since large-scale 
administration of OPV began 20 years ago.Circulating VDPVs in the past have been rapidly stopped with 
2–3 rounds of high-quality immunization campaigns. The solution is the 
same for all polio outbreaks: immunize every child several times with 
the oral vaccine to stop polio transmission, regardless of the origin of
 the virus.Fact sheet on vaccine-derived poliovirus published by the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (PDF)"
When should the fractional dosing method be used?,"Using fractional dosing is the best way to stretch vaccine supplies and protect as many people as possible to stop the spread of yellow fever in emergency situations. Based on the available evidence, the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on Immunization affirms that a fractional dose can be used as part of an exceptional response when there is a large outbreak and a shortage of vaccine."
Will people who receive the emergency dose get a yellow fever certificate?,"A fractional dose does not entitle people to a yellow fever certificate valid for international travel. People, who want to travel internationally, require a full dose of the vaccine. The full dose entitles them to an international yellow fever certificate."
Can children receive a fractional dose of the yellow fever vaccine?,"There is currently no available data to show that a fractional dose of the yellow fever vaccine in children under 2 years of age will provide the same protection as the full dose. Very young children may have a weaker immune response to the vaccine than older people. Therefore, children under 2 years of age should be offered a full dose."
How will vaccination records be kept?,WHO recommends that countries using fractional dosing keep good vaccination records of people who receive it so that they can be followed up later to assess how long the vaccine protection lasts and be revaccinated if necessary. These people will need to be informed that they have received the fractional dose and will require a full dose of the vaccine if they wish to travel.
Is there a greater risk of adverse effects with a fractional dose of the vaccine?,The fractional dose comes from the same full dose vaccine. It has been given to millions of people to prevent yellow fever in the past. It is as safe and as effective as the full dose of the vaccine.Serious adverse effects following a full dose of yellow fever vaccine are extremely rare (less than one per one million people). There is no evidence of increased serious adverse effects when using a fractional dose.
Has this method been used for other vaccines?,"Fractional dosing is currently being used for inactivated polio vaccine (IPV), Rabies and Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG), a vaccine primarily used against tuberculosis."
How can pregnant women protect themselves from mosquito bites?,"Women who are pregnant or planning to become pregnant and their sexual partners should take extra care to protect themselves from the bite of mosquitoes that transmit Zika. Pregnant women living in areas of Zika virus transmission should follow the same prevention guidelines as the general population (see question above).There is no evidence of health risks associated with the use of insect repellents that contain DEET (diethyltoluamide), or IR 3535, or icaridin by pregnant women as long as they are used in accordance with the instructions on the product label.Pregnant women living in areas with ongoing Zika virus transmission should attend their regular antenatal care visits in accordance with national standards and comply with the recommendations of their health-care providers. They should also start antenatal care visits early for diagnosis and appropriate care and follow-up if they develop any of the Zika symptoms or signs."
What can people do to be protected from sexual transmission of Zika virus?,"In regions with active Zika virus transmission, health programmes should ensure that:All people (male and female) with Zika virus infection and their sexual partners (particularly pregnant women) receive information about the risks of sexual transmission of Zika virus.Men and women get counselling on safer sexual practices (including correct and consistent use of male or female condoms, non-penetrative sex, reducing the number of sexual partners, and postponing sexual debut) and be offered condoms.Sexually active men and women should be correctly counselled and offered a full range of contraceptive methods to be able to make an informed choice about whether and when to become pregnant, in order to prevent possible adverse pregnancy and fetal outcomes.Pregnant women practice safer sex or abstain from sexual activity for at least the whole duration of the pregnancy.Pregnant women should be advised not to travel to areas of ongoing Zika virus outbreaks.In regions with NO active Zika virus transmission health programmes should ensure that:Men and women returning from areas where transmission of Zika virus is known to occur should adopt safer sex practices or consider abstinence for at least 6 months upon return to prevent Zika virus infection through sexual transmission.Couples or women planning a pregnancy, who are returning from areas where transmission of Zika virus is known to occur, are advised to wait at least 6 months before trying to conceive to ensure that possible Zika virus infection has cleared.Sexual partners of pregnant women, returning from areas where transmission of Zika virus is known to occur, should be advised to practice safer sex or abstain from sexual activity for at least the whole duration of the pregnancy.Fact sheet: Family planning/ContraceptionUNFPA, WHO and UNAIDS Statement on condoms & prevention of HIV, other STIs and unintended pregnancyPrevention of potential sexual transmission of Zika virus, interim guidance"
What should women do if they have been exposed to unprotected sex but do not wish to become pregnant because of possible infection with Zika?,"All women and girls should have ready access to emergency contraception, including accurate information and counselling as well as affordable methods.Fact sheet: Emergency contraception"
Who might be targeted for vaccination against Zika?,"In emergencies, we focus on the prevention of the most devastating disease manifestation which, in the context of Zika, is congenital Zika virus syndrome. This is a condition occurring in newborns and infants who were exposed to Zika virus infection in utero. For this reason, the priority population to protect through vaccination is women of childbearing age. If resources permit, males of reproductive age would be a second target population.Zika vaccine target product profile"
What steps are required to ensure that a vaccine is safe and effective?,"A number of steps must take place to ensure that vaccines for any disease are safe and effective. The precise requirements depend on the national authority responsible for regulating the approval and licensing of vaccines, the severity of disease, the amount and distribution of disease and the target population. In the case of Zika, after a rigorous evaluation in pre-clinical studies, candidate Zika vaccines will be tested in small numbers of volunteers (Phase I and Phase II trials) to test the vaccine’s safety and its ability and the dosage needed to produce sufficient immune response while minimizing any side effects. Phase II and III trials need to demonstrate that the vaccine works to protect the target population.WHO consultation on regulatory considerations for Zika vaccine for emergency use"
What is the current status of Zika vaccine development?,"WHO is tracking Zika vaccine candidates in the research and development pipeline. We look at databases of clinical trials being conducted and published studies and inquire with developers as to where they are in the process – from basic research to clinical evaluation to regulatory approval to production to commercialization. As of January 2017, about 40 Zika vaccine candidates are in the pipeline. Five of them are entering, or about to enter, Phase I trials in which the vaccine’s safety and ability to produce an immune response is being evaluated. Several other candidates are expected to move to Phase I trials in the coming months.Vaccine pipeline tracker"
How is WHO expediting Zika vaccine R&D?,"The Zika R&D activities are coordinated under WHO’s R&D Blueprint for Action to Prevent Epidemics. This is a strategic plan which allows the R&D community and regulators to fast-track the availability of effective diagnostic tests, vaccines and medicines that can be used to save lives for diseases for which few or no medical countermeasures exist. Zika is one of a number of priority diseases to benefit from the Blueprint.BlueprintList of priority diseases"
When might a Zika vaccine be available?,Registration of first generation Zika vaccines may start in about 2-3 years. Many regulatory authorities have fast-track mechanisms for review and approval of urgently needed vaccines.
What are the characteristics of an ideal Zika vaccine?,"WHO is helping to shape vaccine development through the creation of a target product profile for Zika vaccines for use in an emergency. The profile specifies the preferred and minimal product characteristics for such vaccines. For example, administration of a single dose of Zika vaccine is preferable, but up to 2 doses are acceptable. The vaccine should protect for at least one year in an emergency context, but protection for several years is preferable. The shelf life of a vaccine should be at least 12 months at less than 20°C.Target product profile"
What is contact tracing and why is it important?,"People in close contact with someone who is infected with a 
virus, such as the Ebola virus, are at higher risk of becoming infected 
themselves, and of potentially further infecting others. Closely watching these contacts after exposure to an infected 
person will help the contacts to get care and treatment, and will 
prevent further transmission of the virus.This monitoring process is called contact tracing, which can be broken down into 3 basic steps:Contact identification: Once someone is confirmed as 
infected with a virus, contacts are identified by asking about the 
person’s activities and the activities and roles of the people around 
them since onset of illness.  Contacts can be anyone who has been in 
contact with an infected person: family members, work colleagues, 
friends, or health care providers.Contact listing: All persons considered to have contact 
with the infected person should be listed as contacts. Efforts should be
 made to identify every listed contact and to inform them of their 
contact status, what it means, the actions that will follow, and the 
importance of receiving early care if they develop symptoms. Contacts 
should also be provided with information about prevention of the 
disease. In some cases, quarantine or isolation is required for high 
risk contacts, either at home, or in hospital. Contact follow-up: Regular follow-up should be conducted with all contacts to monitor for symptoms and test for signs of infection."
What is the global impact of tobacco use?,"Tobacco consumption is the single largest preventable cause of 
death, killing more than 7 million people each year, of which  more than
 6 million are users or ex-users of tobacco, and around 890 000 are 
nonsmokers exposed to second-hand smoke.  More than 80% of these deaths 
occur in low- and middle-income countries. Tobacco kills many people at 
the height of their productivity, depriving families of breadwinners and
 nations of a healthy workforce."
What is tobacco control?,"Tobacco control refers to a range of comprehensive measures to 
protect people from the effects of tobacco consumption and second-hand 
tobacco smoke.  To control tobacco use, countries can: 
protect people from exposure to tobacco smokeban tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorshipban tobacco sales to minorsrequire health warnings on tobacco packagingpromote tobacco cessationincrease tobacco taxationcreate national coordinating mechanisms for tobacco control.Tobacco control represents a powerful tool in improving health
 in communities and in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals 
(SDGs). SDG target 3.4 is to reduce premature deaths from NCDs by one 
third by 2030, including cardiovascular and chronic respiratory 
diseases, cancers, and diabetes."
What is the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control?,"The WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC) is 
an international treaty designed by countries as the most powerful tool 
to reduce the health and economic burden caused by tobacco. It entered 
into force in 2005, and implementation of the Convention is called for 
in target 3.a of the Sustainable Development Goals. The WHO FCTC is one 
of the most rapidly embraced treaties in the history of the United 
Nations.
		There are 180 Parties to the Convention, which is legally 
binding, meaning that Parties are required to take incremental action to
 prevent tobacco consumption, marketing and exposure, among many other 
measures. The Convention contains core demand- and supply-reduction 
provisions of proven effectiveness and calls for enhanced international 
cooperation. It also requires Parties to protect their tobacco control 
and public health policies from commercial and other vested interests of
 the tobacco industry."
Why must countries implement the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control?,"Increased trade, foreign investment, global marketing and other
 complex international phenomena have led to the globalization of the 
tobacco epidemic. As the epidemic transcends national borders, its 
control requires international cooperation and multilateral regulation. 
		The WHO FCTC was developed as a global response to the 
globalization of the tobacco epidemic. There is no doubt that reducing 
the rates of uptake and consumption of tobacco will save lives and that 
the WHO FCTC is the evidence-based tool with which to do it.By becoming Parties and implementing the provisions of the WHO
 FCTC where it counts most – at the country level – countries are 
working towards a tobacco-free world and towards millions of lives 
saved."
What was the process for developing the WHO TPP?,"The general overview and process for developing WHO TPPs is available on the WHO website. Consistent with the standard approach, a Working Group of PDVAC was constituted to develop a
draft TPP in April 2016, following declaration of a WHO Public Health Emergency of International
Concern (PHEIC). The document underwent an open public comment period and was discussed in a
WHO stakeholder consultation in Geneva. The first iteration was published in July 2016. Following
the declaration that the PHEIC was over, WHO Secretariat and the PDVAC Working Group revised
the TPP, opened a second public comment period, and it was discussed at a WHO/NIH joint meeting
on Zika vaccine development. The revised TPP was published in February 2017."
For which scenario is this TPP relevant?,"The scenario faced in 2016 and today is that of outbreak response. In the context of an ongoing
epidemic or an imminent outbreak of ZIKV, a mass vaccination campaign will help to prevent ZIKV-associated disease in women of reproductive age. The primary public health objective of vaccination
in this scenario is the prevention of prenatal ZIKV infection, associated microcephaly, other nervous
system malformations and pregnancy-related complications."
"What kind of vaccine is WHO asking for, and for whom?","In emergencies, we focus on the prevention of the most devastating disease manifestation which, in
the context of Zika, is congenital Zika syndrome (CZS). This is a condition occurring in newborns and
infants who were exposed to Zika virus infection in utero. For this reason, the priority population to
protect through vaccination is women of childbearing age so that when pregnant they do not
become infected with Zika virus.Because women of childbearing age may include women who are unknowingly pregnant, or even
knowingly pregnant depending on the risk of disease and the benefit/risk profile of the vaccine,
WHO’s preference is for non-replicating platforms with no documented safety concerns from use
during pregnancy, such as inactivated whole, subunit based and those that use alum as adjuvant. It is
also anticipated that these vaccines, which already have licensed vaccines in their class, would be
faster to license by a regulatory authority than a novel vaccine platform. However, it is considered
important that there be no contraindication for use during pregnancy or in lactating women, and the
vaccine should be safe and effective regardless of prior flavivirus exposure.However, the TPP also outlines minimal criteria for a vaccine that support development of other
platforms, such as DNA/RNA vaccine platforms, viral vectored vaccines, and new adjuvants. These
products may also have favourable characteristics with respect to production capabilities or duration
of protection. If, when a vaccine becomes available, vaccine supply is limited, then vaccine will be prioritized for
women of child-bearing age. However, there are good reasons to vaccinate males as well, such as to
prevent sexual transmission, and should vaccine supply not be limited, males of the same ages
should also be included in the target population. Depending on the vaccine candidate and the risk of
disease, off-label vaccination of pregnant women could be considered by public health agencies."
Does WHO discourage development of other platforms/approaches?,"No. It is not WHO’s intent to discourage development of replication competent approaches, or novel
platforms for ZIKV vaccine development. These may be critical tools for the prevention of Zika
outside the current outbreak context. For example, if ZIKV is or becomes a disease transmitted at
younger ages, a vaccine platform may be prioritized that induces long-term, even life-long durability
to protect women during their child-bearing years. Live, replicating platforms are likely to be
prioritized in this scenario. Thus, investments in a wide range of platforms, even those that do not
meet all preferred criteria in the WHO TPP, are strongly encouraged.WHO is committed to supporting vaccine development and innovative approaches. In the WHO
Mission and Vision for 2015-2030, WHO outlines three strategic directions to support product
development:Promote the development of new vaccines and vaccine delivery technologies to meet public
health priorities,Establish norms and standards for vaccines and delivery technologies, andEnsure vaccines and delivery technologies are of assured quality.WHO will continue to support activities to meet these directions across public health priority
pathogens."
Is WHO expecting clinical trials to demonstrate vaccine protection against congenital Zika syndrome?,"The public health value proposition for a Zika vaccine is to prevent congenital ZIKV syndrome
through the protection of pregnant women against Zika virus infection. However, this value
proposition is different than what is expected in the clinical development program and indication.It is preferred that vaccine candidates demonstrate vaccine efficacy of at least 80% against
virologically-confirmed ZIKV illness, or even against infection if this can be adequately measured. If
vaccine efficacy cannot be measured due to lack of ZIKV transmission, and if a surrogate of immunity
is established through animal models or cohort studies, this could be sufficient to warrant use of the
vaccine. Pending study approval by regulatory authorities, data from a human challenge model may
complement immunogenicity data.It is expected that vaccine prevention of CZS and GBS can be demonstrated only in post-licensure
studies."
Why should I donate blood?,"Safe blood saves lives and improves health. Blood transfusion is needed for:women with complications of pregnancy, such as ectopic pregnancies and haemorrhage before, during or after childbirth;children with severe anaemia often resulting from malaria or malnutrition;people with severe trauma following man-made and natural disasters; andmany complex medical and surgical procedures and cancer patients.It is also needed for regular transfusions for people with conditions such as thalassaemia and sickle cell disease and is used to make products such as clotting factors for people with haemophilia.There is a constant need for regular blood supply because blood can be stored for only a limited time before use. Regular blood donations by a sufficient number of healthy people are needed to ensure that safe blood will be available whenever and wherever it is needed.Blood is the most precious gift that anyone can give to another person — the gift of life. A decision to donate your blood can save a life, or even several if your blood is separated into its components — red cells, platelets and plasma — which can be used individually for patients with specific conditions."
What are the challenges in Zika vaccine R&D?,"Developing a Zika vaccine is complex. For example, we still face many unknowns about Zika virus disease and its complications. Evaluating candidate vaccines in areas with low Zika virus transmission is not easy. We need to develop diagnostic tests which can differentiate Zika infection from other similar viral infections. Getting a safe and effective Zika vaccine to women of childbearing age could, however, be technically feasible based on experience with vaccine development for other similar viruses, such as yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis and tick-borne encephalitis."
What happens once a vaccine is available?,"Once a vaccine is available, WHO’s leading advisory group on immunization, the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on Immunization, performs a comprehensive review of the evidence and makes recommendations to the WHO Director-General for the optimal use of a vaccine for public health impact. WHO issues official recommendations based on the SAGE recommendations, which permit the prequalification and purchase by UN agencies."
Can women transmit Zika virus to their fetuses during pregnancy or childbirth?,"Transmission of Zika virus from pregnant women to their fetuses has been documented.Although Zika virus infection in pregnancy is typically a mild disease, an unusual increase in cases of congenital microcephaly and other neurological complications in areas where outbreaks have occurred has significantly raised concern for pregnant women and their families, as well as among health providers and policy-makers. Pregnant women in general, including those who develop symptoms of Zika virus infection, should see their health-care provider for close monitoring of their pregnancy.Pregnancy management in the context of Zika virus infection"
What should women do if they wish to postpone pregnancy because they are worried about microcephaly?,"Whether and when to become pregnant should be a personal decision, made on the basis of full information and access to affordable, quality health services.Women wanting to postpone pregnancy should have access to a comprehensive range of reversible, long- or short-acting contraceptive options. They should also be counselled on the dual protection against sexually transmitted infections provided by condoms.There are no known safety concerns regarding the use of any hormonal or barrier contraceptive methods for women or adolescent girls at risk of Zika virus, women diagnosed with Zika virus infection, or women and adolescents being treated for Zika virus infection.Pregnancy management in the context of Zika virus infectionEnsuring human rights in the provision of contraceptive information and services - Guidance and recommendationsAdvice for health-care providers on medical eligibility for contraception"
How can women manage their pregnancy in the context of Zika virus and complications?,"Most women in Zika-affected areas will give birth to normal infants.Early ultrasound does not reliably predict fetal malformations. WHO recommends a repeat ultrasound of the fetus in the late second or early third trimester (preferably between 28 and 30 weeks) to identify fetal microcephaly and/or other brain abnormalities when they are easier to detect.Where feasible, screening of amniotic fluid for abnormalities and congenital infections, including Zika virus, is recommended, especially in cases where women test negative for Zika, but their ultrasounds indicate fetal brain abnormalities.Based on the prognosis of associated fetal brain abnormalities, the woman—and her partner if she wishes—should be offered non-directive counselling so that she, in consultation with her health-care provider, can make a fully informed choice about the next steps in the management of her pregnancy.Women carrying their pregnancy to term should receive appropriate care and support to manage anxiety, stress and the birth environment. Plans for care and management of the baby soon after birth should be discussed with the parents in consultation with a paediatrician or paediatric neurologist where available.Women who wish to discontinue the pregnancy should receive accurate information about their options to the full extent of the law, including harm reduction where the care desired is not readily available.Women, whatever their individual choices with respect to their pregnancies, must be treated with respect and dignity.Pregnancy management in the context of Zika virus infectionPsychosocial support for pregnant women and for families with microcephaly and other neurological complications in the context of Zika virusSafe abortion: Technical & policy guidance for health systems.

Can mothers with Zika infection breastfeed their baby?,"WHO recommends exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months of life, also in the context of Zika virus. Zika virus has been detected in breast milk but there is currently no evidence that the virus is transmitted to babies through breastfeeding.Breastfeeding in the context of Zika virus"
What should people travelling to Zika-affected areas do?,"Travellers should stay informed about Zika virus and other mosquito-borne diseases such as chikungunya, dengue and yellow fever, and consult their local health or travel authorities if they are concerned.Pregnant women should be advised not to travel to areas of ongoing Zika virus outbreaks; pregnant women whose sexual partners live in or travel to areas with Zika virus transmission should ensure safer sexual practices or abstain from sex for the duration of their pregnancy.Information for travellers visiting Zika affected countriesTravel advice for health authorities"
What is public health surveillance?,"Public health surveillance is the continuous and systematic collection, analysis and interpretation of health-related data, in order to plan, implement and evaluate public health practice. Public health surveillance is performed routinely to monitor disease trends, and also plays a vital role in responding to epidemics. It can be done by using door-to-door surveys, web surveys, disease registries, laboratory data, and so on. Newer tools currently being employed or considered include data from social networks, genetic data, and non-health related data from various sources."
Why are ethics important in public health surveillance?,"The effectiveness of public health surveillance as a basis for stemming the spread of disease depends on trust: can the people whose data are being collected trust that it will be used to protect their health? If there is no trust, people will not agree to share their data, or if they do, it will be unreliable. Public health surveillance, conducted in a manner that anticipates ethical challenges and seeks proactively to reduce unnecessary risks, will go a long way in building and maintaining trust of the affected populations."
How should communities be involved in public health surveillance?,"Agencies or organizations that conduct public health surveillance should take account of community values, concerns, and priorities in a transparent manner. Communities can’t be engaged if they have no means of knowing about the benefits, and risks (or potential for harm) of surveillance. Active engagement of the community may involve meetings with community leaders, focus group discussions, and other forums that provide an opportunity for members to clearly express their values and concerns. In whatever manner the community is engaged, it is critical that decision-making be transparent, fair, and open to revision. The active inclusion and participation of communities fosters trust and creates conditions for citizens to advance the common good individually and collectively."
How are surveillance ethics different from research ethics?,"The principle guiding values in research ethics are autonomy, privacy and confidentiality. By contrast, the ethics of public health surveillance focuses on the common good, solidarity, accountability, trust and balancing of individual rights with collective interests."
How can potential harms from public health surveillance be avoided?,"Identifiable information like names and addresses of individuals are sometimes part of surveillance records. Using unique identifiers such as numbers instead of names is one way to prevent identities from being inadvertently disclosed. Another is “geo-masking”—that preserves vital information on the spatial distribution of cases but does not pinpoint exactly where the clusters of cases are. Assessing the legal protections for those who might be particularly susceptible to harm is another strategy for ensuring that, in advance of surveillance, broad social protections are in place. In many nations, laws requiring surveillance are paired not only with security protections but clear protections of economic, social, and civil rights."
What are other scenarios in which a Zika vaccine might be important?,"The second scenario is routine/endemic transmission use. Although there is insufficient evidence to
characterize whether endemic transmission is occurring in various parts of the world, it is possible
that Zika circulation could mimic something like Rubella, in which childhood vaccination could be
envisaged as a way to increase population and long-term protection of females to prevent cases of
CZS.There are currently insufficient data to inform a TPP for routine/endemic use. If and when sufficient
data become available to warrant and develop a TPP for routine use, WHO will do so."
What is WHO doing to support development of a Zika vaccine?,"The Zika R&D activities are coordinated under WHO’s R&D Blueprint for Action to Prevent Epidemics.
This is a strategic plan which allows the R&D community and regulators to fast-track the availability
of effective diagnostic tests, vaccines and medicines that can be used to save lives for diseases for
which few or no medical countermeasures exist. Zika is one of a number of priority diseases to
benefit from the Blueprint."
What is WHO's response to Zika?,"Zika virus and its complications such as microcephaly and Guillain-Barré syndrome represent a new type of public health threat with long-term consequences for families, communities and countries. WHO and partners support countries in preparing for and responding to Zika to the fullest extent possible. The main pillars of their work, as outlined in the Zika Strategic Response Plan, July 2016 to December 2017, are:• Detection - Develop, strengthen and implement integrated surveillance systems for Zika virus disease, its neurological complications and other diseases that are transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes. This helps to measure burden of disease to guide sound public health interventions.• Prevention - Prevent complications associated with Zika virus infection through mosquito control that prevents the Aedes mosquito from transmitting Zika virus, chikungunya, dengue and yellow fever to humans; communicate risks to people’s health and engage communities in prevention activities.• Care and support - Strengthen health and social systems to provide appropriate services and support to individuals, families and communities affected by Zika and related complications.• Research – 1) Generate data and evidence needed to strengthen public health and community guidance and interventions to prevent, detect and control Zika virus infection and to manage its complications. 2) Fast track and scale up the research, development and availability of Aedes mosquito control tools, diagnostic tests and vaccines.• Coordination – WHO coordinates the Zika response through close collaboration with more than 60 partners and facilitates information sharing among them and with countries.More on WHO's Strategic Response PlanZika situation report (data on occurrence and/or spread of Zika virus, microcephaly and Guillain-Barré syndrome)Risk communication"
What does WHO recommend countries to do?,"WHO is supporting countries in the areas of detection, prevention, care and support and R&D in line with the Zika Strategic Response Plan. Furthermore, WHO has issued technical guidance for policy-makers and health-care professionals in critical areas of preparedness and response. As listed under the respective questions above, recommendations range from how to provide psychosocial support to pregnant women and families affected by Zika and neurological complications, to how to diagnose Zika virus infection in laboratories to how to protect the health and safety of workers in emergency mosquito control.Zika Strategic Response PlanPublications, technical guidance on Zika virus"
What is the SDG Health Price Tag?,"The Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Health Price Tag is a 
model that estimates the financial investments needed to strengthen 
health systems in order to reach the health targets in the Sustainable 
Development Goals by 2030.The WHO SDG Heath Price Tag is a ballpark estimate, and is not
 prescriptive for what countries should spend. It shows the areas in 
which major investments are needed, and forecasts the extent to which 
different countries can afford them."
What are the main findings?,"The SDG Health Price Tag models two scenarios: an ""ambitious"" 
scenario in which countries reach the health targets in the SDGs by 
2030, and a “progress” scenario in which countries get two thirds or 
more of the way to the targets.In both scenarios, health systems investments such as 
employing more health workers; building and operating new clinics, 
hospitals and laboratories; and buying medical equipment account for 
about 75% of the total cost. The remainder is for medicines, vaccines, 
syringes and other commodities used to prevent or treat specific 
diseases, and for activities such as training, health campaigns and 
outreach to vulnerable communities.Under the ""ambitious"" scenario, achieving the SDG health 
targets would require new investments increasing over time from an 
initial US$ 134 billion annually to $371 billion, or $58 per person, by 
2030.The model includes adding more than 23 million health workers,
 and building more than 415 000 new health facilities, 91% of which 
would be primary health care centres.The investments could prevent 97 million premature deaths – 
one every five seconds over 15 years – including more than 50 million 
infants and children who are either stillborn or die before their fifth 
birthday, and 20 million deaths from noncommunicable diseases such as 
cardiovascular disease, diabetes and cancer. Life expectancy would 
increase by between 3.1 and 8.4 years, and 535 million years of healthy 
living would be added across the 67 countries.The ""progress"" scenario would require new investments 
increasing from an initial US$ 104 billion a year to $274 billion, or 
$41 per person, by 2030. These investments would prevent about 71 
million premature deaths, add more than 14 million new health workers, 
and nearly 378 000 new health facilities, 93% of which would be primary 
health care centres."
Can countries afford it?,"Yes, most can. WHO analysis shows that 85% of the costs can be
 met with domestic resources, although as many as 32 of the world’s 
poorest countries will face an annual gap of up to US$ 54 billion and 
will continue to need external assistance.Investments made under the ambitious scenario would boost 
health spending as a proportion of gross domestic product across all 67 
countries from an average of 5.6% to 7.5%. The progress scenario would 
boost health spending as a proportion of GDP to an average of 6.5%. The 
global average for health spending as a proportion of GDP is 9.9%. 
Although higher spending does not necessarily translate to improved 
health, making the right investments at the right time can.WHO encourages countries to set nationally appropriate 
spending targets for quality investments in essential public services in
 the health sector as well as other social sectors, consistent with 
national sustainable development strategies.Governments can generate more public revenue by broadening the
 tax base, increasing the efficiency of tax collection, and reducing 
corruption and international tax avoidance. Parallel to this, 
governments should also ensure that an appropriate share of public 
revenue is allocated to health.However, it’s not only how much is spent but how
 it’s spent. At the same level of spending, WHO observes a significant 
variance in health system performance across countries due to differing 
levels of efficiency."
"Should public health data be shared, and if so, who with?","In the context of emergency situations, rapid data sharing is imperative. It is also appropriate to share public health data for legitimate research purposes that have been approved by an ethics review committee. But data collected in the name of the public health should never be shared for the purpose of taking action against individuals or for uses unrelated to public health. Access to such personal information by agencies responsible for national security, law enforcement, or the allocation of social benefits should usually be allowed only after legal due process. To preserve trust in public health surveillance systems, there should be a compelling justification for sharing identifiable data for non-public health uses."
Why is oversight important?,"An engaged oversight body can help to identify ethical issues when they arise, consider new evidence or emerging best practices, and deal with vexing problems in an accountable, transparent manner. Decisions that may require ethical oversight include collecting data that reveal stigmatized behaviour; adopting new uses for existing surveillance data, such as for case management or contact tracing; or using public health surveillance data for commercial or security purposes. Oversight is also important to ensure that there is active monitoring for harms and appropriate data sharing. But mechanisms for the ethical oversight can also help to ensure that states meet their obligations to conduct surveillance responsibly."
What is the purpose of the PIP Framework?,"The Pandemic Influenza Preparedness Framework (PIP Framework) 
is helping Member States, laboratories, industry, and civil society work
 together to better prepare the world for an influenza pandemic.The PIP Framework was set up to introduce greater equity and 
solidarity among nations when the next pandemic strikes. The best 
defense against influenza is vaccination. However, many countries do not
 have the capacity to develop vaccines on their own, relying instead on 
products manufactured by others.  Moreover, with current technologies, 
producing a safe and efficacious vaccine requires at least 4–6 months 
from the time a virus emerges. Even then production will take time – 
therefore, each dose that will become available will be precious. Under the PIP Framework, WHO will have real-time access to 
approximately 10% of global vaccine production and will be able to send 
life-saving doses to developing countries in need.  In this manner, all 
countries – whether rich or poor – will have access to some vaccine at 
the same time."
How does the PIP Framework work?,"The PIP Framework has two goals that are pursued on an equal footing, promoting: the sharing of influenza viruses that could cause a pandemic, and access to capacity-development and products such as vaccines. Influenza viruses are shared through the Global Influenza 
Surveillance and Response System (GISRS), a network of more than 150 
public health laboratories located around the world. In addition to 
serving as a virus sharing platform, GISRS also shares genetic sequence 
data derived from these viruses, develops and shares reagents, and 
undertakes risk assessments. One of its critical functions is to develop
 candidate vaccine viruses, which are used by manufacturers to develop 
vaccines against seasonal and pandemic influenza.In exchange for receiving influenza viruses with pandemic 
potential and associated data from GISRS, manufacturers contribute to 
pandemic preparedness in two ways: they pay an annual Partnership 
Contribution (totaling US$ 28 million) to WHO, and they agree, under 
legally binding contracts, to provide vaccines, antivirals, diagnostic 
kits or other products to WHO at the time of the next pandemic ."
How is the annual US $28 million Partnership Contribution spent?,"Partnership Contribution is split between preparedness funds, 
which are used to help countries prepare for a pandemic, and response 
funds, which are placed in a contingency fund that will be drawn upon in
 case of a pandemic. Currently 70% of funds are used for preparedness 
and 30% are allocated for response, as decided by the WHO Executive 
Board. Funds allocated for preparedness support five areas of work: laboratory and surveillance capacitiesburden of disease studiesregulatory capacitiesrisk communicationsplanning for deployment.Within these areas of work, priority countries were chosen on 
the basis of various criteria including existing capacity and funding. A
 new high-level implementation plan is being developed, in consultation 
with industry, civil society, and other partners, to determine future 
priority areas and countries.Partnership Contribution Implementation Portal"
What chemicals can be used as chemical weapons?,"In principle, any toxic chemical in combination with a suitable delivery method can be used to inflict harm. During the 20th century, a number of groups of chemicals were developed on a large-scale as weapons. This category of weapon employs the toxicity of their active components to cause temporary incapacitation, permanent harm or death. Chemical weapons can be irritants, choking agents, disabling chemicals, blistering agents, nerve agents, or asphyxiants. Depending on the agent involved, and on the means for dispersal, chemical weapons can be in liquid, solid or gaseous forms. The development, stockpiling, transfer and use of chemical weapons are banned under the prohibitions of the Chemical Weapons Convention, which came into force in April 1997."
What is plague?,"Plague is an infectious disease found in some small mammals and 
their fleas. People can contract plague if they are in bitten by 
infected fleas, and develop the bubonic form of plague. Sometimes 
bubonic plague progresses to pneumonic plague, when the bacteria reaches
 the lungs. Person-to-person transmission is possible through the 
inhalation of infected respiratory droplets of a person who has 
pneumonic plague. Common antibiotics are efficient to cure plague, if 
they are delivered very early, because the course of the disease is 
usually rapid. Fact sheet on plague"
What are the types of plague and how do people become infected?,"There are two main forms of plague infection, depending on the
 route of infection: bubonic and pneumonic. All forms are treatable and 
curable if detected early enough. Bubonic plague is the most common form of plague globally
 and is caused by the bite of an infected flea. Plague bacillus, Y. 
pestis, enters at the bite and travels through the lymphatic system to 
the nearest lymph node where it replicates itself. The lymph node then 
becomes inflamed, tense and painful, and is called a ""bubo"". At advanced
 stages of infection the inflamed lymph nodes can turn into open sores 
filled with puss. Human to human transmission of bubonic plague is rare.
 Bubonic plague can advance and spread to the lungs, which is the more 
severe type of plague called Pneumonic plague. Pneumonic plague – or lung-based plague – is the most 
virulent form of plague. Incubation can be as short as 24 hours. Any 
person with pneumonic plague may transmit the disease via droplets to 
other humans. Untreated pneumonic plague, if not diagnosed and treated 
early, is fatal. However, recovery rates are high if detected and 
treated in time (within 24 hours of onset of symptoms)."
What is diphtheria?,"Diphtheria is an infection caused by the bacterium Corynebacterium diphtheriae.
 Signs and symptoms usually start 2 – 5 days after exposure and range 
from mild to severe. Symptoms often come on gradually, beginning with a 
sore throat and fever. In severe cases, the bacteria produces a poison 
(toxin) that causes a thick grey or white patch at the back of 
throat. This can block the airway making it hard to breathe or swallow 
and also create a barking cough. The neck may swell in part due to 
enlarged lymph nodes.
The poison may also get into the blood stream 
causing complications that may include inflammation and damage of the 
heart muscle, inflammation of nerves, kidney problems, and bleeding 
problems due to low blood platelets. The damaged heart muscles may 
result in an abnormal heart rate and inflammation of the nerves may 
result in paralysis."
How is diphtheria spread?,"Diphtheria spreads easily between people by direct contact 
or through the air though respiratory droplets, like from coughing or 
sneezing.  It may also be spread by contaminated clothing and objects."
How is diphtheria diagnosed?,"Clinical diagnosis of diphtheria usually relies on the presence of
 a greyish membrane covering the throat. Although laboratory 
investigation of suspected cases is recommended for case confirmation, 
treatment should be started immediately."
How is diphtheria treated?,"Diphtheria infection is treated with the administration of a 
diphtheria antitoxin, administered intravenously or through an 
intramuscular injection. Antibiotics are also given to eliminate the 
bacteria and toxin production, and to prevent transmission to others."
Are diphtheria vaccines recommended?,"All children worldwide should be immunized against diphtheria.
 A 3-dose primary series during infancy is the foundation for building 
lifelong immunity to diphtheria. Further, immunization programmes should
 ensure that 3 booster doses of diphtheria toxoid-containing vaccine are
 provided during childhood and adolescence. At any age those who are 
unvaccinated or incompletely vaccinated against diphtheria should 
receive the doses necessary to complete their vaccination.  
Recent diphtheria outbreaks in several countries reflect 
inadequate vaccination coverage and have demonstrated the importance of 
sustaining high levels of coverage in childhood immunization programmes.
 Those who are unimmunized are at risk regardless of the setting. An 
estimated 86% of children worldwide receive the recommended 3 doses of 
diphtheria-containing vaccine when they are infants, leaving 14% with no
 or incomplete coverage."
How were these estimates produced?,"WHO analysed existing databases to assess country data on 
disease burden, health service coverage, and health system performance. 
We grouped countries into five categories in terms of their health 
systems and financial capacity.We considered how health services could be scaled up through 
four categories of health service delivery from policy and community 
interventions like taxes and regulations up to hospital services. Next, 
we identified what investments are needed to bring countries towards 
global benchmarks in terms of health system performance targets, health 
service coverage, and overall health outcomes. These activities and 
investments are modelled by country and by year, and multiplied by 
country-specific prices. Investments are modelled to increase over time.
 The majority of the analysis was done in the OneHealth Tool, a software
 application whose development is overseen by WHO and other UN agencies."
What is not included in your estimates? What is missing?,"For some areas there is a lack of good data and projection 
models, such as injury prevention, road traffic accidents, chemical 
poisoning, and hepatitis, so we have not included them in the analysis.Interventions were also excluded for which current coverage 
levels could not be identified and/or there is limited agreement on what
 target levels to strive for (such as for oral health, assistive 
technologies, and consumables like gloves and laboratory reagents).The costs of research and development were not included. While
 technological innovation will be important to enable us to deliver 
services more efficiently in the future, there is considerable 
uncertainty around the size of future gains and when those will happen. 
Moreover, while future technologies may be more cost-effective, they 
also may be more expensive and require additional resources than what we
 have modelled. Given the uncertainty, we did not attempt to model a 
forecasted change in technology whereby more effective technologies are 
implemented than what is available today.For all of the reasons above, these estimates should be 
considered as minimum indicative estimates. WHO plans to update the 
model with more data as it becomes available."
Why did you only include 67 countries?,"WHO decided to include all low-income countries, the 20 
most-populous lower-middle-income countries, and the 20 most populous 
upper-middle-income countries. Some countries were excluded from the 
final dataset because they did not have the required data available for 
GDP projections, and other countries changed income category 
classification during the course of the analysis, such that in the end 
there were 28 low-income countries and 39 middle-income countries.These jointly account for 95% of the population in low- and 
middle-income countries, and 75% of the global population. Notably, 
Russia is not included because it was classified as a high-income 
country when we started our work, although it has since been 
reclassified as a middle-income country.High income countries are not included to allow focus on those
 countries that face the greatest challenges in increasing service 
provision and resource mobilization to progress towards the SDG health 
targets."
So what should my country spend on health?,"We have not published a breakdown of costs by country, because
 the purpose of the SDG Health Price Tag is to give a global overview of
 the types of investments needed to strengthen health systems, rather 
than a prescription for what individual countries should spend.Countries can request assistance from WHO to set priorities 
and estimate resource needs through the WHO-CHOICE programme of work and
 the OneHealth Tool, which would closely replicate the methods used in 
this study."
Can you guarantee that the SDG health targets will be reached if countries meet these spending levels?,"No. Achieving the SDG health targets is not simply a matter of
spending money. Political commitment to pursuing the targets is vital,
as is respect for human rights. Making wise investments in health
system, coupled with stronger institutions are likely to bring about the
wanted changes."
What is HIV?,"The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) targets cells of the immune system, called CD4 cells, which help the body respond to infection. Within the CD4 cell the HIV replicates and in turn damages and destroys the cel.l Without effective treatment, using a combination of antiretroviral drugs, the immune system will become weakened to the point that it can no longer fight infection and disease."
Is AIDS different from HIV?,"Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is a term that applies to the most advanced stages of HIV infection. It is defined by the occurrence of any of the more than 20 life-threatening cancers or “opportunistic infections”, so named because they take advantage of a weakened immune system. AIDS was a defining feature of the earlier years of the HIV epidemic, before antiretroviral therapy (ART) became available. Now, as more and more people access ART, most people living with HIV do not progress to  AIDS. However, it is more likely to occur in people with HIV who have not been tested, in people who are diagnosed at a late stage of infection, and in people who are not taking ART."
What is the relationship between seasonal and pandemic influenza viruses?,"Seasonal and pandemic influenza are connected and both are 
shared within GISRS.  The PIP Framework only applies to influenza 
viruses that have the potential to cause a pandemic. A pandemic virus may develop from a mutated seasonal virus. 
The laboratory detection and analysis capacity required for seasonal 
viruses is the same as that required for detecting a potentially 
pandemic virus. Also, the capacity to produce a pandemic vaccine depends
 on robust seasonal vaccine production – in a pandemic, manufacturers 
will use the same seasonal vaccine production facilities to produce the 
pandemic vaccine."
Who oversees the implementation of the PIP Framework?,"An Advisory Group of 18 independent experts from all six WHO 
regions advises the Director-General on the implementation of the PIP 
Framework and interacts with industry, civil society, and other 
stakeholders. The Director-General promotes the PIP Framework’s 
implementation, while the World Health Assembly is ultimately 
responsible for oversight, direction, and coordination.What are the results of the 2016 review of the PIP Framework?
In 2016, the PIP Framework was reviewed for the first time, and progress
 in implementation was assessed. The key conclusion is that the PIP 
Framework is a “bold and innovative tool” for preparedness that has 
ensured “confidence and greater predictability” in the world’s ability 
to respond to an influenza pandemic. Review of the PIP Framework: Report by the Director-General
The review offers several recommendations to improve implementation, such as: to produce with urgency recommendations to clarify the handling of genetic sequence data;to undertake a study to determine the implications and desirability of including seasonal influenza viruses in the PIP Frameworkto develop a comprehensive evaluation model to allow for more regular and thorough assessment of progress."
What treatment exists?,"In most cases treatment involves removal from exposure, decontamination and symptomatic and supportive care, but the type of treatment required will differ depending on the chemicals involved. Antidotes are available for a small number of chemicals, for example for some nerve agents. These antidotes should be administered under medical supervision as soon as possible after exposure."
How would I know if a chemical had been released?,"There are a number of features that suggest a toxic chemical has been released: the more features noted, the stronger the likelihood. These include the following: an unexplained smell, such as a smell of garlic, horseradish, onions, bleach or a fruity smell; a visible mist or cloud not consistent with the weather; the presence of droplets or an oily film on surfaces; the presence of a suspicious device, such as an exploded shell or an abandoned tanker (especially in close proximity to the smell or mist); multiple sick or dead animals, and multiple sick or dead people. Some typical symptoms include: eye irritation, itchy nose, sneezing, coughing, difficulty in breathing, runny eyes and nose, drooling, itchy or stinging skin, a sudden urge to urinate, defecate or vomit, blurred vision, muscle twitching, dizziness, disorientation, feeling faint."
What can I do to protect myself if I think that a chemical has been released?,"You should try to move away from the source as quickly as possible, staying upwind if you can (i.e. so that any wind is blowing the chemical away from you) or moving crosswind. Many chemical weapons are heavier than air so it is usually a good idea to move to higher ground. If the release was outdoors, then moving into a building onto an upper floor and closing windows, doors, vents and switching off any equipment that draws air in from outside (e.g. air-conditioners) will provide some protection."
What should I do if I think that I have been exposed to a chemical weapon?,"Most chemical weapons are harmful by inhalation and some are also harmful by skin contact and absorption. Some chemicals have a rapid effect, such as most nerve agents, while others may not cause effects for a number of hours, such as mustard agents. It is important to remove chemicals from your skin as quickly as possible to prevent them from being absorbed and from injuring your skin. Clothing provides some limited and temporary protection from skin exposure and taking off your clothes will often remove a large proportion of the chemical. Since contaminated clothing will provide a source of exposure to others e.g. anyone coming to your assistance, removing your clothes and placing them in a closable container (e.g. a strong plastic bag) will also protect other people. You should also try to wash yourself with soap and water, or with water alone, not forgetting your hair and ears. If your eyes are irritated then rinse them with clean, cool water for several minutes. You should then seek medical help. For more information on decontamination see below."
How can I decontaminate myself?,"Once you have moved away from the source and found a safe place, you should remove your clothes as quickly as possible (see below), then wash your entire body and hair with soap and water (ideally), or with water alone. Do not scrub as this may damage the skin and increase absorption of the chemical. If your eyes are irritated then rinse them with clean, cool water for several minutes.When removing your clothes you should try to avoid spreading chemicals from the clothes onto your skin, for example do not pull clothes over your head if possible – it is better to cut them off. Try not to touch any wet or powdery areas. Put the clothes into a container that you can close e.g. a strong plastic bag. Try to avoid touching contaminated clothes with your bare hands – use an implement or wear thick rubber gloves. Put any contaminated personal effects or other objects into the same bag. Close the bag securely and, if possible, put this bag into another bag and close that tightly. Remember that the contents are contaminated so put a warning on the bag and put the bag in a secure place outside until it can be disposed of.If possible, decontaminate yourself before going to get medical attention. Firstly this will reduce your own exposure to the chemical. Secondly, it will prevent you from contaminating other people, including health care workers, and also the treatment centre. Do not be surprised if you are put through another decontamination process before being allowed into a treatment facility."
How should I help someone who has been exposed to a chemical weapon?,"You should take care not to become contaminated yourself. You should not enter a chemically-contaminated area unless you have been trained to work in such an area and are wearing a full chemical protection suit with self-contained breathing apparatus (sometimes called Level A protection). If you are assisting a victim who has left the contaminated area you should still wear specialised personal protective equipment, including chemically-resistant suit and gloves, eye protection and respirator with an air purifying filter. If this equipment is not available and the victim is conscious and able to move then encourage the victim undress and wash him or herself. Find medical help for the victim as quickly as possible. Note that you should not take chemically-contaminated victims into a health care facility otherwise you will risk contaminating the facility and poisoning staff and other patients. Victims should be decontaminated before entering a health care facility."
What are the effects of exposure to nerve agents?,"Nerve agents include substances such as sarin, tabun and VX. Some pesticides show a similar mode of action but are less toxic than nerve agents. These chemicals are absorbed by inhalation, and through the skin and mucous membranes. They are also toxic if swallowed, for example by ingesting contaminated food or water. Once absorbed they affect the nervous system and cause, amongst other things, runny nose, watery eyes, drooling, sweating, vomiting and diarrhoea, incontinence, tightness of the chest and difficulty breathing, coughing, confusion, muscle twitching, collapse and convulsions."
What should I do if I think I have been exposed to nerve agent?,"You should try to move away from the source as quickly as possible, staying upwind if you can (i.e. so that any wind is blowing the chemical away from you) or moving crosswind. Nerve agents are heavier than air and will tend to sink to low-lying areas, therefore move to higher ground if you can.Once you have reached a safe area, you should remove your clothing as quickly as possible (see below), and wash your entire body, including your hair, with soap and water (ideally), or water alone. Do not scrub as this may damage the skin and increase absorption of the chemical. If your eyes are irritated then rinse them with clean, cool water for several minutes. You should then seek medical help.When removing your clothes you should try to avoid spreading chemicals from the clothes onto your skin, for example do not pull clothes over your head if possible – it is better to cut them off.

Close the bag securely and, if possible, put this bag into another bag and close that tightly. Remember that the contents are contaminated so put a warning on the bag and put the bag in a secure place outside until it can be disposed of."
What are the effects of exposure to chlorine?,"Chlorine is a greenish-yellow gas with a distinctive bleach-like smell. It is intensely irritant and exposure will immediately result in stinging and watering of the eyes, you may start coughing, have a feeling of tightness of the chest, difficulty in breathing, headache and nausea and vomiting. After severe exposure, pulmonary oedema may develop after 12-36 hours. Chlorine may also cause skin irritation, and exposure to compressed gas as it is released from pressure can cause frostbite."
What should I do if I think I have been exposed to chlorine?,"You should try to move away from the source as quickly as possible, staying upwind if you can (i.e. so that any wind is blowing the chemical away from you) or moving crosswind. Since chlorine is heavier than air you should avoid low-lying areas and move to higher ground.Once you have reached a safe area, you should remove your clothing as quickly as possible (see below) and wash your entire body with soap and water (ideally), or water alone. If your eyes are irritated then rinse them with clean, cool water for several minutes. You should then seek medical help.If you think you have been exposed to liquid chlorine (for example if you were close to a discharging cylinder of chlorine) then you should take care when removing your clothes to try to avoid spreading chemicals from the clothes onto your skin, for example do not pull clothes over your head if possible – it is better to cut them off. Try not to touch any wet areas. If clothing is stuck to your skin do not pull it off – soak the area in tepid water and try to ease the clothing off. Put the clothes into a container that you can close e.g. a strong plastic bag. Try to avoid touching contaminated clothes with your bare hands – use an implement or wear thick rubber gloves. Put any contaminated personal effects or other objects into the same bag. Close the bag securely and, if possible, put this bag into another bag and close that tightly. Remember that the contents are contaminated so put a warning on the bag and put the bag in a secure place outside until it can be disposed of."
What are the effects of exposure to mustard gas?,"There are a number of different types of mustard agent e.g. sulphur mustard and nitrogen mustard but they are all blistering agents. You can be exposed by skin or eye contact and by inhaling the vapour. These agents are also toxic if swallowed, for example by ingesting contaminated food or water. Mustard agents can linger in the environment for several days.Mustard agents are irritant chemicals that can cause blistering and damage to the skin, eyes and lungs. Exposure may relatively quickly result in eye irritation, coughing, hoarseness and mild irritation to the skin, but often the severe effects of exposure, including characteristic blistering, are delayed for several hours. Effects can include painful eyes and difficulty in seeing, retching and vomiting, itching and reddening of the skin and the formation of blisters, coughing, sneezing, difficulty breathing and chest infection. Exposure to mustard agents does not usually result in death."
What is antimicrobial resistance?,"Antimicrobial resistance occurs when microorganisms such as 
bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites change in ways that render the 
medications used to cure the infections they cause ineffective. When the
 microorganisms become resistant to most antimicrobials they are often 
referred to as “superbugs”. This is a major concern because a resistant 
infection may kill, can spread to others, and imposes huge costs to 
individuals and society. 

		Antimicrobial resistance is the broader term for resistance in
 different types of microorganisms and encompasses resistance to 
antibacterial, antiviral, antiparasitic and antifungal drugs. Antimicrobial resistance occurs naturally but is facilitated 
by the inappropriate use of medicines, for example using antibiotics for
 viral infections such as cold or flu, or sharing antibiotics. 
Low-quality medicines, wrong prescriptions and poor infection prevention
 and control also encourage the development and spread of drug 
resistance. Lack of government commitment to address these issues, poor 
surveillance and a diminishing arsenal of tools to diagnose, treat and 
prevent also hinder the control of antimicrobial drug resistance."
What is the difference between antibiotic and antimicrobial resistance?,"Antibiotic resistance occurs when bacteria change in response
to the use of antibiotics used to treat bacterial infections (such as
urinary tract infections, pneumonia, bloodstream infections) making them
ineffective.
Antimicrobial resistance is a broader term, encompassing
resistance to drugs that treat infections caused by other microbes as
well, such as parasites (e.g. malaria or helminths), viruses (e.g. HIV)
and fungi (e.g. Candida)."
What are the symptoms of plague?,"Symptoms typically include sudden onset fever, chills, head and 
body aches and weakness, vomiting and nausea. Painful and inflamed lymph
 nodes can also appear during bubonic plague. Symptoms of the pneumonic 
form appear quickly after infection (sometimes less than 24 hours), and 
include severe respiratory symptoms such as shortness of breath and 
coughing, often with blood-tainted sputum."
How does pneumonic differ from bubonic plague?,"Bubonic plague is the most common form of plague, but cannot be 
easily transmitted between people. Some people with bubonic plague will 
develop pneumonic plague, meaning the infection spreads to their lungs. 
Pneumonic plague can be transmitted between people through coughing. 
Bubonic plague has a mortality rate of 30% to 60%, while the pneumonic 
form is fatal in the absence of treatment. Both types have good recovery
 rates if people are treated in time."
How can I protect myself from being infected with plague?,"To prevent the spread of pneumonic plague, avoid close contact 
(under 2 meters) with someone who is coughing, and reduce time spent in 
crowded areas. To prevent bubonic plague, do not touch dead animals and 
wear insect repellent while in plague endemic areas."
What should I do if I suspect I have plague?,"In case of sudden symptoms of fever, chills, painful and inflamed 
lymph nodes, or shortness of breath with coughing and/or blood-tainted 
expectoration, people should immediately contact a medical provider for 
an evaluation. (Travellers who have left plague-affected areas should 
inform their health worker of their travel history to a plague-affected 
area.) People should avoid self-medication, including using antibiotics,
 unless they are diagnosed by a health worker."
How do you diagnose plague?,"Health workers make an evaluation based on symptoms. Confirmation 
is based on laboratory testing  from a sample of blood, sputum (fluid 
coughed up from inside the lungs) or pus from a bubo."
How can plague be treated?,"Plague can be treated with antibiotics, and recovery is common if 
treatment starts early. In areas where there is a plague outbreak, 
people with symptoms should go to a health centre for evaluation and 
treatment.  Patients with pneumonic plague must be isolated and treated 
by trained medical staff wearing personal protective equipment."
"If I am in an area with an active plague outbreak, should I wear a mask to protect myself?","It depends on your level of exposure to sick people. People living
 in communities where there is a plague can wear masks if they wish, but
 masks must be used and disposed of properly so they do not become a 
source of infection themselves. Masks may help to reduce the spread of 
pneumonic plague if they are used correctly by people who are sick (to 
reduce the spread of droplets), and by health care workers (to protect 
themselves)."
Do dead bodies spread plague?,"The body of someone who has died after being infected with plague 
can infect people who are in close contact, such as those who are 
preparing the body for burial. The source of infection is the bacteria 
that are still present in body fluids."
Do health-care workers need to take extra precautions?,"In endemic settings and outbreaks, health-care workers may be
at greater risk of diphtheria than the general population. Consequently,
special attention should be paid to immunizing health-care workers who
may have occupational exposure to Corynebacterium diphtheriae."
Are suicides preventable?,"Yes, suicides are preventable and effective interventions exist. First and foremost, early identification and treatment of depression and alcohol use disorders are key for the prevention of suicide at individual level, as well as follow-up contact with those who have attempted suicide and psychosocial support in communities. Equally important are effective interventions at population level aiming to reduce access to the means of suicide, to adopt responsible reporting of suicide by the media, and to introduce alcohol policies to reduce the harmful use of alcohol. From the health systems perspective, it is imperative for health-care services to incorporate suicide prevention as a core component."
Is suicide really a problem? How many people die by suicide every year?,"Every year close to 800 000 people die as a result of suicide. This is one death every 40 seconds. Beyond this, suicide has a ripple effect that impacts on societies, communities, friends and families who have lost a loved one to suicide. So, yes, suicide really is a serious public health problem."
How many people attempt suicide every year?,"There are indications that for each person who dies of suicide there are likely to be more than 20 others who attempt suicide. This ratio differs widely by country, region, sex, age and method."
Are suicides preventable?,"Yes, suicides are preventable and effective interventions exist. First and foremost, early identification and treatment of depression and alcohol use disorders are key for the prevention of suicide at individual level, as well as follow-up contact with those who have attempted suicide and psychosocial support in communities. Equally important are effective interventions at population level aiming to reduce access to the means of suicide, to adopt responsible reporting of suicide by the media, and to introduce alcohol policies to reduce the harmful use of alcohol. From the health systems perspective, it is imperative for health-care services to incorporate suicide prevention as a core component."
"Without treatment, how quickly can a person living with HIV become ill?","For people living with HIV who are not diagnosed or taking ART, signs of HIV-related illness may develop within 5–10 years, although it can be sooner. The time between HIV transmission and an AIDS diagnosis is usually 10–15 years, but sometimes longer."
How is HIV transmitted?,"HIV is found in certain bodily fluids of people living with HIV, including blood, semen, vaginal fluids, rectal fluids and breastmilk. HIV can be transmitted by: unprotected vaginal or anal sex, and, in very rare cases, through oral sex with a person living with HIV;blood transfusion of contaminated blood;sharing of needles, syringes, other injecting equipment, surgical equipment or other sharp instruments; and from a mother living with HIV to her infant during pregnancy, childbirth or breastfeeding. If a person living with HIV is on ART, which effectively suppresses HIV in the body, their chance of transmitting HIV to another person is greatly reduced."
How is HIV infection treated?,"While there is no cure for HIV infection, it can be treated using antiretroviral drugs, which work by stopping the replication of the virus. ART can reduce the level of virus to such low levels in the body that the immune system will function normally, and a person living with HIV can enjoy good health, provided they adhere to treatment and the treatment remains effective. People living with HIV are also much less likely to transmit the virus to others when treatment is working."
What does “undetectable” mean?,"Evidence from several studies show that people living with HIV who have an “undetectable” viral load cannot pass HIV on to others. A person is “undetectable” when ART has reduced the level of virus in their body to such low levels that it cannot be detected by normal viral load tests. Monitoring of viral load, and confirmation of an undetectable viral load, needs to be undertaken by a healthcare professional as part of the routine medical care for people with HIV. In many low- and middle-income countries, viral load tests are not consistently or routinely available, so many people do not benefit from the knowledge that they are undetectable. They can be assured, however, that the risk of transmitting HIV is greatly reduced when they adhere to treatment, and when treatment is started without delay."
What illnesses can affect people living with HIV?,"ART allows people with HIV to live long and healthy lives by ensuring that their immune system remains healthy. In certain settings, however, many people living with HIV remain undiagnosed, not on treatment, or not taking consistent treatment, and, as a result their HIV disease progresses. Tuberculosis (TB) is the number one cause of death among people living with HIV in Africa, and a leading cause of death among people living with HIV worldwide. Routine TB-symptom screening and early initiation of ART can greatly improve the health outcomes of people living with HIV. Other common HIV coinfections include hepatitis B and C in some populations.  HIV infection can result in a range of health problems. As people living with HIV age and live longer, non-AIDS defining illnesses are becoming more common. These include heart disease, cancer and diabetes."
How can people get tested for HIV?,"Testing for HIV is the only way to know if a person has HIV or not. HIV can be diagnosed using rapid diagnostic tests that provide results within minutes. However, such results should only be considered as a full diagnosis following review and confirmation
    by a qualified health worker. Knowledge of one’s HIV-positive status has two important benefits:People who test positive can take steps to get treatment, care and support before symptoms appear, which can prolong life and prevent health complications for many years.People who are aware of their status can take precautions to prevent the transmission of HIV to others. WHO recommends that HIV tests be made available in all health facilities, in key community settings and at home via self-testing."
Who is at more risk of HIV?,"The main routes of HIV transmission include unsafe sex without condoms, receiving blood transfusions or other blood products contaminated with HIV, sharing of needles and syringes and other injecting equipment, being exposed to HIV through contaminated surgical and other skin piercing equipment and vertical transmission from mothers with HIV to their children. HIV is fully preventable; different interventions exist to stop transmission. However, many people are not accessing necessary information and skills to prevent HIV. In some cases, major legal and social barriers prevent people from accessing effective prevention services and measures. Some populations are at higher risk of HIV infection, including men who have sex with men; people who inject drugs; people in prisons and other closed settings; sex workers and their clients; and transgender people. These populations are referred to as ‘key populations’, who are often marginalized in communities and experience major barriers in accessing HIV prevention and treatment and other health services. In some settings, other populations may be particularly vulnerable to HIV infection, such as adolescent girls in southern Africa."
How can sexual transmission of HIV be prevented?,"Globally, HIV is mainly transmitted through unprotected vaginal and anal sex. Several methods can be used to prevent this from happening. It is recommended that a combination of effective prevention interventions be used, including:using male and/or female condoms consistently and correctly;for HIV-negative people, taking pre-exposure prophylaxis of HIV (PrEP) to prevent HIV transmission;for people living with HIV, taking ART to reduce viral load to undetectable levels, meaning they can’t transmit HIV to their sexual partners; andbeing aware of one’s status to promote less risky sexual behaviours."
How can vertical transmission of HIV be prevented?,"HIV can be transmitted from a mother to her child during pregnancy, labour, delivery or breastfeeding. But such vertical transmission can be prevented with effective interventions, including the use of ART by the mother and a short course of antiretroviral drugs for the baby. Other effective interventions include measures to prevent HIV acquisition in pregnant woman, prevent unintended pregnancies in women with HIV and appropriate breastfeeding practices. HIV testing services should be integrated into maternal and child health services, so that they women at risk can readily access testing. Pregnant women and mothers diagnosed with HIV should receive ART as soon as possible, so that their children are born free from HIV."
What is PrEP?,"Pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP, is a course of antiretroviral drugs that HIV-negative people can take to prevent HIV acquisition. When taken as recommended, it can practically eliminate the chance of acquiring HIV. PrEP is recommended for populations who are at higher risk of HIV. These groups may include men who have sex with men, sex workers, people who use drugs, and young women in southern Africa."
How does male circumcision prevent HIV transmission?,"Male circumcision reduces the risk of sexual transmission from a woman to a man by around 60%. A one-time intervention, medical male circumcision provides life-long partial protection against HIV, as well as other sexually transmitted infections. It should always be considered as part of a comprehensive HIV prevention package, and should never replace other known methods of prevention, such as female and male condoms."
What is 'One Health'?,"'One Health' is an approach to designing and implementing 
programmes, policies, legislation and research in which multiple sectors
 communicate and work together to achieve better public health outcomes.The areas of work in which a One Health approach is 
particularly relevant include food safety, the control of zoonoses 
(diseases that can spread between animals and humans, such as flu, 
rabies and Rift Valley Fever), and combatting antibiotic resistance 
(when bacteria change after being exposed to antibiotics and become more
 difficult to treat)."
Why do we need a One Health approach?,"Many of the same microbes infect animals and humans, as they 
share the eco-systems they live in. Efforts by just one sector cannot 
prevent or eliminate the problem. For instance, rabies in humans is 
effectively prevented only by targeting the animal source of the virus 
(for example, by vaccinating dogs).Information on influenza viruses circulating in animals is 
crucial to the selection of viruses for human vaccines for potential 
influenza pandemics. Drug-resistant microbes can be transmitted between 
animals and humans through direct contact between animals and humans or 
through contaminated food, so to effectively contain it, a 
well-coordinated approach in humans and in animals is required."
Who makes the One Health approach work?,"Many professionals with a range of expertise who are active in
 different sectors, such as public health, animal health, plant health 
and the environment, should join forces to support One Health 
approaches.To effectively detect, respond to, and prevent outbreaks of 
zoonoses and food safety problems, epidemiological data and laboratory 
information should be shared across sectors. Government officials, 
researchers and workers across sectors at the local, national, regional 
and global levels should implement joint responses to health threats.WHO works closely with the Food and Agriculture Organization 
of the United Nations (FAO) and the World Organisation for Animal Health
 (OIE) to promote multi-sectoral responses to food safety hazards, risks
 from zoonoses, and other public health threats at the 
human-animal-ecosystem interface and provide guidance on how to reduce 
these risks."
What should I do if I think I have been exposed to mustard gas?,"You should try to move away from the source as quickly as possible, staying upwind if you can (i.e. so that any wind is blowing the chemical away from you) or moving crosswind. Avoid touching contaminated surfaces and any pools of liquid or water that may be contaminated. Mustard agents are heavier than air and will tend to sink to low-lying areas, therefore move to higher ground if you can.Once you have reached a safe area, you should remove your clothing as quickly as possible (see below) and wash your entire body, including your hair, with soap and water (ideally), or water alone. Do not scrub as this may damage the skin and increase absorption of the chemical. If your eyes are irritated then rinse them with clean, cool water for several minutes. You should then seek medical help.When removing your clothes you should try to avoid spreading chemicals from the clothes onto your skin, for example do not pull clothes over your head if possible – it is better to cut them off. Try not to touch any wet areas. Put the clothes into a container that you can close e.g. a strong plastic bag. Try to avoid touching contaminated clothes with your bare hands – use an implement or wear thick rubber gloves. Put any contaminated personal effects or other objects into the same bag. Close the bag securely and, if possible, put this bag into another bag and close that tightly. Remember that the contents of the bag are contaminated so put a warning on the bag and put the bag in a secure place outside until it can be disposed of."
Has WHO published any guidance on the management of exposure to chemical weapons?,"WHO has published guidance on the public health response to biological and chemical weapons. It is available on the WHO website:Public health response to biological and chemical weaponsA range of information sheets on exposure to chemicals can be found in English and Arabic on the following webpages:Deliberate eventsRegional Centre for Environmental Health ActionIn addition, information on a wide range of chemicals is available on the International Programme on Chemical Safety INCHEM websiteProgramme on chemical safety INCHEMConcise information on chemicals, in the form of International Chemical Safety Cards, which are developed by WHO and the International Labour Organization (ILO), can be viewed on the ILO website.International chemical safety cards"
Is there any guidance on the impact on the mental health of populations of exposure to chemical weapons?,WHO has published guidance on this subject in Mental Health of Populations Exposed to Biological and Chemical Weapons.Mental health of populations exposed to biological and chemical weapons
Can chemical weapons pose a threat to the food chain?,"Following the release of a chemical weapon, food and/or water may become contaminated. In addition, chemicals may deliberately be introduced into the food chain or water supply. The nerve agents sarin and tabun mix easily with water and, depending on their concentration in the water, they could cause poisoning if the water was consumed or was used on the skin. These chemicals are not persistent in water, however, and usually degrade over 1-2 days. The nerve agent VX is less soluble but more persistent, breaking down into a chemical that is toxic by ingestion. In water, mustard agents may form globules surrounded by a protective outer layer. These globules may settle out and may persist for several years, continuing to pose a hazard by contact and by ingestion. You should avoid contact with, and consumption of, food or water that you think might be contaminated.WHO has published guidance on protecting the food and water supply systems from deliberate chemical contamination, as follows:Precautions against the sabotage of drinking-water, food, and other productsTerrorists threats to food"
How can chemical weapons be detected?,"Detection and monitoring for the presence of chemical weapons is the task of specialized units in most countries. There are commercially available detection kits for the commonly known chemical weapons, and civil authorities, such as fire brigades, police, emergency medical personnel and the military can use these. The effects of chemical weapons will usually be rapidly apparent."
How can chemical weapons be disposed of or destroyed?,"The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) has the responsibility for overseeing and verifying the safe and secure destruction of these weapons in countries that are Parties to the Chemical Weapons Convention. A number of techniques, including incineration, exist for destroying chemical weapons but older methods such as dumping, burial, or open-pit burning are prohibited under the Chemical Weapons Convention."
What is WHO’s role if chemical weapons are used?,"In accordance with World Health Assembly resolution WHA55.16 adopted in May 2002, technical support is available to Member States from WHO in developing or strengthening preparedness for, and response to, the deliberate use of biological and chemical agents to cause harm.Under the International Health Regulations, WHO provides assistance to Member States in dealing with the public health consequences of chemical and other emergencies and will therefore respond if assistance is requested.If requested, WHO will also provide technical support for the UN Secretary-General’s Mechanism to investigate the alleged use of chemical and biological weapons, but WHO has no formal role in investigating the use of chemical weapons.The statement by the World Health Assembly in resolution WHA20.54 of 25 May 1967 that “scientific achievements, and particularly in the field of biology and medicine – that most humane science – should be used only for mankind’s benefit, but never to do it any harm” remains as valid today as it was then."
What other organizations could assist in responding to deliberate chemical release?,"The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), which is the implementing organization for the Chemical Weapons Convention, can provide assistance if chemical weapons are used or threatened.Member States of the OPCW can request international assistanceOPCW has published a “Practical Guide for Medical Management of Chemical Warfare Casualties”"
How concerned is WHO about the so-called “super malaria” parasite in South-East Asia?,"First, let me emphasize that the term “super malaria” has not been adequately defined; the scientific and public health community does not recognize this term.The problem of multidrug resistance in the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS), including in Viet Nam, has been well known to WHO for a number of years. In 2014 and 2015, 4 studies conducted by Viet Nam’s National Malaria Control Programme (NMCP), in collaboration with WHO, already demonstrated high treatment failure rates with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP)1 ranging from about 26% to 46%. The Lancet letter confirms data published earlier this year by the NMCP Viet Nam and WHO and gives us a clearer picture of the genetic background of the parasites responsible for these high treatment failure rates.While we are obviously concerned by multidrug resistance in Viet Nam, we are very encouraged by 2 recent developments. First, in September 2016, Viet Nam’s NMCP changed its policy for first-line treatment of malaria, replacing DP (in provinces where DP is failing) with artesunate-mefloquine, an effective treatment against the drug-resistant strain of malaria parasites reported in the Lancet letter. Secondly, the NMCP, under the auspices of WHO, has been testing a new artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) called artesunate-pyronaridine; preliminary data show that the drug has a very high efficacy rate, even in areas in Viet Nam that contain the drug-resistant strain.Moreover, it is important to note that since 2008, when artemisinin resistance was first detected in the GMS, there has been a major decline in the rate of malaria cases and deaths. According to WHO estimates, malaria case incidence in GMS countries fell by 54% between 2012 and 2015. Malaria death rates fell by 84% over the same period. Last year, there were approximately 200 malaria deaths and less than 300 000 cases reported in the 5 GMS countries. Insufficient access to prompt diagnosis and treatment (and not drug resistance) remains the major risk factor for malaria-related deaths in this subregion.Finally, parasite resistance to antimalarial medicines is a serious problem. But we must not create unnecessary alarm. Providing timely access to malaria prevention, diagnosis and treatment should be our primary focus."
Some news reports claim that the drug-resistant strain of malaria parasites detected in Viet Nam cannot be killed by current antimalarial medicines. Is this accurate?,"No. The newly adopted first-line treatment in Viet Nam, artesunate-mefloquine, remains highly efficacious against this strain as does the new ACT artesunate-pyronaridine. Up until now, we have had effective treatment options for all malaria parasites that have been detected globally."
What is the likelihood that drug-resistant malaria will spread from the GMS to India and Africa?,"In December 2016, at the request of the Malaria Policy Advisory Committee (MPAC), WHO’s top advisory committee for malaria, an Evidence Review Group (ERG) analysed the body of evidence on the emergence and spread of multidrug-resistant P. falciparum in the GMS over the last decade. A full report of this ERG meeting is available on the WHO website as well as the subsequent endorsement of the reportby MPAC in March 2017.While the group recognized that the risk of drug-resistant malaria spreading to India and Africa cannot be discounted, the broad consensus was that drug-resistant parasites were more likely to emerge independently in other parts of the world than to spread directly from the GMS.It is difficult, however, to estimate this risk with any level of precision. In some cases, resistance to antimalarial medicines (like chloroquine) has spread to other regions. In other cases (as with mefloquine), it has not."
Could resistance to artemisinin-based combination therapies in the GMS have the same consequences that resistance to chloroquine did several decades ago?,"Again, it would be difficult to make a prediction with any high degree of confidence. However, there are several important considerations to bear in mind.First, when chloroquine resistance emerged in Africa in the 1980s, malaria control across the continent was very limited. As an example, the proportion of the population sleeping under a bednet was less than 1%.Fortunately, since then, the malaria landscape has changed dramatically. With the massive roll-out of effective vector control,2 improved case management through diagnostics and combination therapies, improvements to health systems, increased monitoring of drug efficacy and clear guidance on policy changes, the consequences of drug-resistant malaria – should it ever reach India or Africa – are likely to be less severe today than those observed with chloroquine in the 1980s.Secondly, we expect that – with investments in research and development – new tools, including new medicines, will enable us to overcome the challenge of multidrug resistance in the Greater Mekong Subregion."
Does WHO consider the threat of antimalarial drug resistance a public health emergency of international concern?,"Not at this time. A public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC), as defined in the International Health Regulations (IHR), is an “extraordinary event.” These regulations were designed to address acute (as opposed to chronic) public health conditions. The public health community has known of the emergence and spread of multidrug resistance in this subregion for many years and is addressing it through the work of national malaria control and elimination programmes.Meeting in both 2012 and 2014, the Technical Expert Group on Drug Resistance and Containment concluded that artemisinin resistance does not constitute a PHEIC because the conditions for PHEIC are not met. These conclusions were endorsed by MPAC."
How many people attempt suicide every year?,"There are indications that for each person who dies of suicide there are likely to be more than 20 others who attempt suicide. This ratio differs widely by country, region, sex, age and method."
Is suicide really a problem? How many people die by suicide every year?,"Every year close to 800 000 people die as a result of suicide. This is one death every 40 seconds. Beyond this, suicide has a ripple effect that impacts on societies, communities, friends and families who have lost a loved one to suicide. So, yes, suicide really is a serious public health problem."
How effective are condoms in preventing HIV?,"When used correctly and consistently every time a person has sex, condoms are among the most effective means of preventing HIV infection in women and men."
Is there a cure for HIV?,"No, there is currently no cure for HIV. But with good and continued adherence to ART, HIV infection can be contained and managed as a chronic health condition. In all parts of the world, people living with HIV are now surviving and thriving into old age."
What other kinds of care do people living with HIV need?,"While ART helps the immune system stay strong, people living with HIV can benefit from counselling and psychosocial support to ensure that they are truly “living well” with HIV. HIV is manageable, but it is a life-long chronic illness, and people may need support with their mental health and with lifestyle changes to support good health through life. Access to good nutrition, safe water and basic hygiene can also help people living with HIV to maintain a good quality of life. As with the general community, people living with HIV may experience a broad range of other health conditions that may need treatment and care. A people-centred approach to health care, particularly through primary health services, aims to deliver comprehensive health services to people living with HIV, in which all their health issues are addressed."
What is WHO doing to stop the spread of antimalarial drug resistance in the Greater Mekong?,"WHO has coordinated and led global efforts to counter artemisinin resistance from the very beginning, providing technical guidance and mobilizing partners to action. In 2013, WHO launched the Emergency response to artemisinin resistance (ERAR) in the Greater Mekong Subregion, a high-level plan of attack to contain the spread of drug-resistant parasites and to provide life-saving tools for all populations at risk of malaria.In 2015, GMS Ministers of Health adopted the WHO Strategy for malaria elimination in the Greater Mekong Subregion (2015-2030). The plan aims to eliminate P. falciparum malaria from the subregion by 2025 and all species of human malaria by 2030. Priority action is targeted to areas where multidrug resistant malaria has taken root. This subregional strategy is fully aligned with the goals and targets of the WHO Global Technical Strategy for Malaria 2016-2030, adopted by the World Health Assembly in May 2015.With technical guidance from WHO, all GMS countries have developed national malaria elimination plans. Providing access to prevention, diagnosis and treatment for all populations at risk of malaria is a key priority. Monitoring drug efficacy and strengthening surveillance systems are other core elements of our work. Other priorities in this subregional effort are described in detail in a report published last November.WHO’s work in the GMS is a collaborative effort involving technical teams based at 6 country offices, at regional offices in New Delhi and Manila, at a special regional hub in Phnom Penh, and at WHO’s Geneva headquarters. It is a unique initiative in view of the human resources deployed and the level of integration across many layers of the Organization.WHO is leading the elimination effort in the GMS with the support of a number of partners, including the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis & Malaria, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, USAID, and the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.We are winning the battle. We are on the right track. The massive reductions in disease and death reported in GMS countries are a testament to the sustained progress that has been achieved along the path toward elimination in this subregion. It is only through eliminating this parasite that we will do away – once and for all – with the problem of drug resistance in this subregion.Drug resistance in the Greater Mekong Subregion: a brief historyThe GMS has long been the epicentre of antimalarial drug resistance. Parasites resistant to chloroquine were first detected in the late 1950s along the Cambodia–Thailand border. Resistance of P. falciparum malaria parasites to artemisinin was first confirmed along the Cambodia–Thailand border in 2008. To date, artemisinin resistance has been detected in 5 countries of the GMS: Cambodia, Lao People’s Democratic Republic (PDR), Myanmar, Thailand and Viet Nam.Resistance to ACT partner drugs has also emerged in some areas of the GMS. Treatment failure with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP) was reported in Cambodia as early as 2009 and, more recently, in Lao PDR. Four studies conducted by Viet Nam’s NMCP in 2014 and 2015 demonstrated high treatment failure rates for the drug DP.When artemisinin resistance was first confirmed along the Cambodia–Thailand border in 2008, WHO took immediate action to contain its spread. A coordinated regional effort to eliminate malaria transmission in the GMS is critical to protecting the efficacy of existing antimalarial medicines.Key definitions: ACTs and artemisinin resistanceArtemisinin and its derivatives are very effective medicines known for their ability to swiftly reduce the number of parasites in the blood of patients with malaria. Artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) are recommended by WHO as the first-line treatment for uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria. Over the last 15 years, expanded access to ACTs in malaria-endemic countries has played an important role in reducing the global burden of malaria.ACTs combine artemisinin with one of several partner drugs. The role of artemisinin is to dramatically reduce the number of parasites in the bloodstream during the first 3 days of treatment. The role of the partner drug is to eliminate any remaining parasites thereafter.Artemisinin resistance is defined as a delay in the clearance of parasites from the bloodstream following treatment with an ACT. Currently, most patients with delayed parasite clearance are still cured by ACTs provided the partner drug remains effective. As such, protecting the efficacy of artemisinin and its partner drugs is critically important."
What’s the good news in this year’s World malaria report 2017?,"There are several bright spots in this year’s report. First, more countries are accelerating towards elimination. In 2016, 44 countries reported less than 10 000 malaria cases, compared to just 37 countries in 2010. For the second consecutive year, the WHO European Region continued to be malaria-free.We are seeing that coverage rates of access to tools to prevent malaria, such as insecticide-treated bednets (ITNs), have increased across most WHO regions in 2016 when compared to 2010. Another positive development is that testing of suspected malaria cases in the public health sector has gone up significantly in most regions since 2010. The largest rise was recorded in the African Region, where diagnostic testing increased from 36% in 2010 to 87% in 2016. However, across all malaria control interventions, we remain significantly below the targets for universal access.Another piece of good news is that all regions recorded declines in malaria mortality in 2016 when compared to 2010, with the exception of the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region where mortality rates have remained largely unchanged.Read the World Malaria Report 2017"
What findings concern you in the report?,"When we look closer at the data, the declining trend in malaria cases and deaths has stalled and even reversed in some regions, at least over the past three years. Equally concerning are continued gaps in coverage of basic prevention, diagnostic and treatment tools. As noted in the report, less than half of households in countries in sub-Saharan Africa have sufficient bednets, and only about one third of children in the African Region with a fever are taken to a medical provider in the public health sector."
"After years of progress, why are we seeing a slowdown in the global fight against malaria?","Globally, we can safely say that after an unprecedented period of success, we are no longer making progress, which is supported by the data in this year’s report.Identifying what is behind this trend is difficult to pinpoint; in any given country, there may be a multitude of reasons as to why the burden of malaria is increasing. Factors impacting progress could range from insufficient funding and gaps in malaria prevention interventions to climate-related variations. Without more data, it is challenging to identify, with any degree of certainty, a specific cause for the trends we are seeing. What is paramount now is taking this year’s malaria report as a wake-up call to stimulate action."
The cover of the World malaria report depicts a crossroads sign. What is the message you are communicating?,"The notion of a crossroads is meant to sum up the current status of the global response to malaria: with current levels of funding, and coverage of current tools, we have reached the limits of what can be achieved in the fight against this disease. The fact that funding for malaria has plateaued, that the number of malaria cases in 2016 is similar to the number of cases in 2012, and that there remain huge gaps in coverage of key malaria control tools, all make clear that unless we increase our efforts, we are not going to see any further progress."
Why is there a sharp decline in the use of indoor residual spraying?,"The proportion of the population at risk protected by indoor residual spraying (IRS), an intervention that involves spraying the inside walls of dwellings with insecticides, declined globally from a peak of 5.8% in 2010 to 2.9% in 2016, with decreases seen in all WHO regions. The number of people protected in 2010 was 180 million globally, reducing to about 100 million in 2016.While there is yet no clear evidence of why this is happening, the decreases in coverage with IRS insecticides are occurring as countries change or rotate the chemicals they are using to try to prevent the spread of mosquitoes resistant to pyrethroids. Because alternative insecticides are more expensive than pyrethroids, increased funding for IRS is needed to maintain high coverage levels of this key intervention to rapidly reduce malaria transmission."
How big a threat is resistance to antimalarial medicines and resistance to insecticides to global efforts to control and eliminate malaria?,"WHO takes resistance to any effective disease-cutting tools very seriously. We are working with all malaria-endemic countries to monitor the efficacy of artemisinin-based antimalarial drugs.This year’s report provides a comprehensive situation analysis to capture, by WHO region, the status of antimalarial drug efficacy. Overall, the immediate threat of antimalarial drug resistance is low and artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) remains efficacious in all malaria-endemic settings. Insecticide resistance is more widespread, particularly pyrethroids, which are used in bednets and for indoor residual spraying.A large multicountry evaluation coordinated by WHO between 2011 and 2016 showed that insecticides continue to be an effective tool for malaria prevention, even in areas where mosquitoes have developed resistance to pyrethroids. Further, there is no clear correlation between insecticide resistance and trends in malaria burden: some countries with resistance to pyrethroids have shown reductions in disease burden; others with less resistance have shown an increase. Ultimately, we need more data on the public health impact of insecticide resistance and further investments in this area."
Is the level of funding for the global malaria response on track to reach the 2020 targets of the global malaria strategy?,"No, the level of resources for malaria today is not sufficient to achieve the GTS targets. In 2016, an estimated US$ 2.7 billion was invested in malaria control and elimination efforts globally. This amount falls far short of our annual GTS funding target for 2020 (US$ 6.5 billion).Overall, funding for malaria has levelled off since 2010 and, when analysed on a country-by-country per capita basis, funding has decreased for many high-burden countries, averaging below US$ 2 per person at risk annually. This level translates into fewer resources available to protect increasing populations at risk of malaria.Despite the significant financial and economic crises experienced by many countries in the last few years, it is commendable that funding levels have remained stable. Still, to reach the 2020 targets of the GTS, increasing international financing and the contributions of endemic countries will be critical."
What is dengue and how is it treated?,"Dengue is a viral infection transmitted by the bite of an
infected female Aedes mosquito. There are four distinct serotypes of the
dengue virus (DEN 1, DEN 2, DEN 3 and DEN 4). Symptoms appear in 3–14
days (average 4–7 days) after the infective bite. Dengue fever is a
flu-like illness that affects infants, young children and adults.
There is no specific treatment for dengue fever. Severe dengue
is a potentially lethal complication but early clinical diagnosis and
careful clinical management by experienced physicians and nurses often
save lives.
More than 70% of the disease burden is in South-East Asia and
the Western Pacific. In Latin America and the Caribbean, the incidence
and severity of disease have increased rapidly in recent years. The
African and Eastern Mediterranean regions have also recorded more
outbreaks of the disease in the last ten years. Since 2010 indigenous
transmission of dengue has also been reported in Europe. Urbanization,
rapid movement of people and goods, favorable climatic conditions and
lack of trained staff have all contributed to the global increase of
dengue."
What is Cannabidiol and is it safe?,"Cannabidiol is one of several (probably 200) compounds of the cannabis plant.At its November 2017 meeting, the WHO Expert Committee on Drug
 Dependence (ECDD) concluded that, in its pure state, cannabidiol does 
not appear to have abuse potential or cause harm.  As such, as CBD is 
not currently a scheduled substance in its own right (only as a 
component of cannabis extracts), current information does not justify a 
change in this scheduling position and does not justify scheduling of 
the substance.However, where CBD is produced for pharmaceutical purposes as 
an extract of cannabis, cannabis extracts and tinctures are included in 
the 1961 UN Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs. A fuller review of 
extracts or preparations containing almost exclusively CBD will take 
place in June 2018, when the WHO expert committee will undertake a 
comprehensive review of cannabis and cannabis related substances.Not scheduling a substance means that it is not subject to 
strict international controls, including for production and supply.  Its
 legal status in countries is something for national legislators to 
decide. Some countries have eased regulations around cannabidiol, to 
consider products containing CBD to be medical products.  These include 
Australia, Canada, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United 
States of America."
What evidence is there that Cannabidiol has value for medical use?,"WHO does not recommend cannabidiol for medical use. Initial 
evidence from animal and human studies (i.e. a controlled study in the 
New England Journal of Medicine and other reported individual cases) 
shows that its use could have some therapeutic value for seizures due to
 epilepsy and related conditions.Some people have been using cannabidiol to calm spasms during 
epileptic fits.  The New England Journal of Medicine also published a 
study lately saying there is some evidence it may be effective during 
epileptic seizures.  This means it could have some medical use but more 
evidence is needed."
What is typhoid fever?,"Typhoid fever is a life-threatening infection caused by the bacterium Salmonella Typhi.It is usually spread through contaminated food or water.Symptoms include prolonged fever, fatigue, headache, nausea, 
abdominal pain, and constipation or diarrhoea. Some patients may have a 
rash. Severe cases may lead to serious complications or even death.Typhoid fever can be treated with antibiotics although 
increasing resistance to different types of antibiotics is making 
treatment more complicated.Even when the symptoms go away, people may still be carrying 
typhoid bacteria, meaning they can spread it to others through their 
faeces.An estimated 11–20 million people get sick from typhoid and 
between 128 000 and 161 000 people die from it every year. Poor 
communities and vulnerable groups including children are at highest 
risk."
How can I protect myself from typhoid fever?,"Typhoid fever is common in places with poor sanitation and a
lack of safe drinking water. Access to safe water and adequate
sanitation, health education, appropriate hygiene among food handlers,
and typhoid vaccination are all effective strategies for prevention and
control of typhoid.
Vaccines have been used for many years to prevent typhoid:

an injectable vaccine based on the purified antigen for people over 2 years of age
a live attenuated oral vaccine in capsule formulation for people over 5 years of age.

These vaccines do not provide long-lasting immunity and are not approved for children younger than 2 years.
In December 2017, WHO prequalified the first conjugate vaccine
for typhoid. This new vaccine has longer-lasting immunity than older
vaccines, requires fewer doses, and can be given to children from the
age of 6 months.
This vaccine will be prioritized for countries with the
highest burden of typhoid disease. This will help reduce the frequent
use of antibiotics for typhoid treatment, which will slow the increase
in antibiotic resistance in Salmonella Typhi."
Why is emergency risk communication guidance needed?,"During public health emergencies, people need to know what health risks they face, and what actions they can take to protect their lives, their health, their families and communities.Accurate information, provided early, often, and in language and channels people understand, trust and use, enables people to make choices that can protect them from health hazards threatening their lives and well-being."
What is new about this guidance?,"WHO has manuals, training modules and other forms of emergency communication and risk communication guidance based on expert opinion or lessons drawn from major environmental disasters, such as the SARS outbreak of 2003 and the H1N1 influenza pandemic of 2009, rather than systematic analysis of the evidence. This is the first ever evidence-based risk communications guidance.The recommendations in this guidance are based on a systematic search of the evidence on key issues in emergency risk communication practice and experience. Not only was the academic structured evidence searched but also ‘grey literature’ to ensure that the lessons learned from recent emergencies, such as the West African Ebola virus disease outbreak in 2014–2015 and the global Zika virus outbreak in 2015–2016, were captured and explored fully.Evidence for decision making"
Who should use this guidance?,"These guidelines were developed for policy- and decision-makers responsible for managing emergencies, particularly the public health aspects of emergencies, and practitioners responsible for risk communication before, during and after health emergencies.Other groups expected to use these guidelines are front-line responders, local, national and international development partners, civil society, the private sector and all organizations, private and public, involved in emergency preparedness and response."
What are they key recommendations in this guidance?,"These guidelines provide WHO Member States, partners and stakeholders involved in emergency preparedness and response with evidence-based, up-to-date, systems-focused guidance on:building trust and engaging with communities and affected populations;integrating risk communication into existing national and local emergency preparedness and response structures, including building capacity for risk communication;emergency risk communication practice - from planning, messaging, channels and methods of communication and engagement to monitoring and evaluation - based on a systematic assessment of the evidence on what worked and what did not work during recent emergencies."
How should these guidelines be used?,"The recommendations in these guidelines provide overarching, evidence-based guidance on how risk communication should be practiced in an emergency. The recommendations also guide countries to build capacity for communicating risk during health emergencies. Specific ‘how-to-do-it’ step-by-step instructions are beyond the remit of these guidelines. However, in due course, these will be provided in detailed manuals, standard operating procedures, pocket guides, checklists, training modules and other tools developed to elaborate the recommendations."
What is the WHO malaria NAAT EQA scheme?,"The purpose of the WHO malaria NAAT EQA scheme is to offer an independent and periodic means for clinical, reference and research laboratories to verify the quality of their nucleic acid amplification (NAA)-based malaria diagnostic methods and to monitor performance over time. This is achieved through the provision of well-characterized and quality-controlled panels consisting of a blinded mix of Plasmodium-positive and -negative samples. Participants are then issued an EQA report upon submission of their analysis results. Participation in the scheme is voluntary, and results are confidential.The WHO malaria NAAT EQA scheme is coordinated by the WHO's Global Malaria Programme and distributed by the United Kingdom National External Quality Assessment Service (UK NEQAS), with a priority given to not-for-profit laboratories based in developing countries. Participation so far is free of charge.The scheme will enable laboratories to obtain an independent assessment of their NAA-based diagnostic methods in order to determine if they meet the minimum level of quality required. If any laboratory does not meet this requirement, some level of remote technical support will be offered. The laboratory will have the opportunity work on identifying and addressing any source of error in order to improve the quality and reliability of its methods."
Who can participate in the WHO NAAT EQA scheme?,"Any laboratory using NAA-based methods such as nested PCR, RT-PCR, LAMP or NASBA to detect malaria parasites is eligible for enrolment in the WHO NAAT EQA scheme. However, given that the scheme is currently run with limited funding, priority is given on a first come, first serve basis to not-for-profit laboratories based in developing countries, with the aim to generate a balance of laboratories according to testing indication, i.e. research, surveillance/surveys and geography. Laboratories wishing to participate should send a message to MalNAATEQA@who.int. In addition, calls for interest in participation are sent out to potentially interested laboratories, and enrolment is complete once favourable responses are received and letters of agreement between WHO and the participating laboratories are signed.Besides offering the free WHO NAAT EQA scheme coordinated by WHO, UK NEQAS also coordinates its own malaria molecular scheme that is subject to fees for participation ( http://www.ukneqasmicro.org.uk/parasitology/index.php/molecular-detection-of-malaria). Laboratories should participate in either the WHO scheme or the UK NEQAS scheme, but not both at the same time."
What is the frequency of panel distributions?,"The WHO NAAT EQA scheme distributes EQA panels twice a year, usually once at the end of January and once at the end of July. Exact dates depend on the practical organization of the scheme, i.e. the readiness of panels and capacity at UK NEQAS. Dates are confirmed by e-mail communication when calls for interest in participation are sent out, usually about 4–8 weeks ahead of each round of panel distributions."
Who is organizing the WHO NAAT EQA scheme?,"The WHO malaria NAAT EQA scheme is coordinated by WHO, in collaboration with Public Health England (PHE) through UK NEQAS, with support from the Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics (FIND). WHO is responsible for the overall coordination and promotion of the scheme, while UK NEQAS holds the central repository of EQA materials and manages the scheme operations. This includes the preparation, characterization, storage and shipping of EQA panels; the issuance of EQA reports to the participating laboratories; and the handling of any logistical queries. The EQA panels undergo independent testing by referee laboratories before being distributed to the laboratories participating in the scheme.Currently, FIND provides financial support to the overall scheme and remote technical support to the participating laboratories, if required. WHO also organizes regular meetings (at least yearly) of an Advisory Group to review the scheme procedures, provide technical expertise for potential modifications to procedures and principles, review overall results of the scheme, including complaints, and discuss actions required to address major issues, if any."
How can I get enrolled in the WHO NAAT scheme?,"Interest in participation can be communicated by e-mail at any time to the WHO/GMP contact at MalNAATEQA@who.int. Calls for interest in participation are also sent out by e-mail to potentially interested laboratories about 4–8 weeks before each round of panel distributions. A Letter of Agreement (LOA) and laboratory profile template are issued to the interested institution or organization.The laboratory profile template requires participants to provide contact and shipping information (including special requirements such as permits for importation of biological samples), and to describe the laboratory’s capacity for identifying Plasmodium spp. It, along with the LOA (between the participating laboratory and WHO), needs to be completed and sent back to MalNAATEQA@who.int. Once the LOA has been signed by both parties and the laboratory profile is complete, the laboratory is registered in the scheme for an unlimited period of time. The laboratory will receive login details to connect to the UK NEQAS webportal for the WHO NAAT EQA scheme, and will be contacted ahead of each round of panel distributions to organize shipments."
What is a laboratory profile template and why am I being asked for this?,"The laboratory profile is a template that contains a series of questions to be completed before a laboratory can enrol in the WHO NAAT EQA scheme. Its purpose is to clarify which types of malaria diagnosis will be done on the EQA panels at the laboratory, i.e. which nucleic acid extraction and amplification methods will be used, and most importantly, the laboratory’s capacity in terms of diagnostic outputs, e.g. detection of Plasmodium spp. only or additional identification of species, including P. knowlesi or not.The scheme organizers need this critical information in order to accurately calculate success scores when laboratories submit their EQA testing results. Correct completion of the laboratory profile is mandatory for enrolment in the WHO NAAT EQA scheme."
What is multidrug-resistant tuberculosis and how do we control it?,"The bacteria that cause tuberculosis (TB) can develop resistance to the antimicrobial drugs used to cure the disease. Multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) is TB that does not respond to at least
isoniazid and rifampicin, the 2 most powerful anti-TB drugs.
The 2 reasons why multidrug resistance continues to emerge and
spread are mismanagement of TB treatment and person-to-person
transmission. Most people with TB are cured by a strictly followed,
6-month drug regimen that is provided to patients with support and
supervision. Inappropriate or incorrect use of antimicrobial drugs, or
use of ineffective formulations of drugs (such as use of single drugs,
poor quality medicines or bad storage conditions), and premature
treatment interruption can cause drug resistance, which can then be
transmitted, especially in crowded settings such as prisons and
hospitals. 
In some countries, it is becoming increasingly difficult to
treat MDR-TB. Treatment options are limited and expensive, recommended
medicines are not always available, and patients experience many adverse
effects from the drugs. In some cases even more severe drug-resistant
TB may develop. Extensively drug-resistant TB, XDR-TB, is a form of
multidrug-resistant TB with additional resistance to more anti-TB drugs
that therefore responds to even fewer available medicines. It has been
reported in 117 countries worldwide.
Drug resistance can be detected using special laboratory tests
which test the bacteria for sensitivity to the drugs or detect
resistance patterns. These tests can be molecular in type (such as Xpert
MTB/RIF) or else culture-based. Molecular techniques can provide
results within hours and have been successfully implemented even in low
resource settings.
New WHO recommendations aim to speed up detection and improve
treatment outcomes for MDR-TB through use of a novel rapid diagnostic
test and a shorter, cheaper treatment regimen. At less than US$ 1000 per
patient, the new treatment regimen can be completed in 9–12 months. Not
only is it less expensive than current regimens, but it is also
expected to improve outcomes and potentially decrease deaths due to
better adherence to treatment and reduced loss to follow-up.
Solutions to control drug-resistant TB are to:

cure the TB patient the first time around
provide access to diagnosis
ensure adequate infection control in facilities where patients are treated
ensure the appropriate use of recommended second-line drugs.

In 2016, an estimated 490 000 people worldwide developed
MDR-TB, and an additional 110 000 people with rifampicin-resistant TB
were also newly eligible for MDR-TB treatment. The countries with the
largest numbers
of MDR/RR-TB cases (47% of the global total) were China, India and the
Russian Federation. It is estimated that about 6.2% of these cases were
XDR-TB."
What about malaria elimination – are countries progressing?,"Yes, there is progress towards elimination, but the picture is mixed. Of the 91 countries with malaria transmission, 37 reported fewer than 10 000 cases in 2010 and, by 2016, that number rose to 44 countries. Kyrgyzstan and Sri Lanka were certified by WHO as malaria free in 2016, and Algeria, which remained malaria free in 2016, is now eligible for certification. Further, Argentina and Paraguay have begun the certification process.One of the 2020 milestones of the WHO Global Technical Strategy for Malaria 2016- 2030 (GTS) is eliminating malaria in at least 10 countries that had malaria transmission in 2015. This means that a country must achieve at least one year of zero indigenous cases by 2020.Early last year, WHO identified 21 countries with the potential to reach the 2020 elimination target. Our latest World malaria report shows that 11 of these countries have recorded increases in indigenous malaria cases since 2015, and 5 countries reported an increase of more than 100 cases in 2016 compared with 2015. Nonetheless, I am optimistic that at least 10 countries will meet the target.Read the Global Technical Strategy for Malaria"
How does WHO arrive at its estimates for cases in the World malaria report?,"WHO applies 3 methods for calculating estimates of malaria cases. One method uses routine data from countries without any adjustments; in other words, we use the data ""as is"", directly from the country. This approach applies to countries that have very low malaria cases, high-quality surveillance systems, and are near elimination.The second method is for countries outside of sub-Saharan Africa, excluding Botswana, Ethiopia, Namibia and Rwanda, that have a good public health surveillance system but where a large proportion of patients seek care in the private sector or do not seek treatment at all. Here, adjustments for confirmation, reporting and treatment seeking rates are applied to the reported data.The third method applies to most countries in the WHO African Region where surveillance systems have been historically weak. As a result, to come up with a reliable estimate, we measure the relationship between parasite prevalence and case incidence within a specific area."
The World malaria report 2017 indicates that this year’s estimates are conservative. What does this mean?,"In many countries in the African Region, improvements in surveillance systems are providing new insights. Data from these countries show that the existing WHO model used to estimate malaria cases – i.e. parasite rate to incidence – is likely underestimating the actual number of cases in many countries in the region. In 2018, WHO will do a comprehensive review of our malaria burden estimation methods for the African Region."
This year’s report looks at the impact of emergencies and political instability on malaria progress. Why include this?,"As part of the report’s section on threats to global malaria progress, we highlight concrete examples of the impact of conflict, humanitarian crises and political volatility on malaria control and elimination efforts. The 4 case studies on malaria epidemics in Nigeria, South Sudan, Yemen and the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela demonstrate the fragility of progress and how gains can be reversed, even due to a short period of conflict or economic shocks. For example, Venezuela’s northern region was certified as malaria free in 1961, but last year it was the leading country in the Americas in terms of malaria burden. And in Yemen, due to the ongoing humanitarian situation, there is a reversal of progress under way with an increase in malaria cases seen in 2016."
Last question – what are you most concerned about in the global fight against malaria?,"Malaria represents one of the biggest success stories in recent times in terms of best value for money in public health. Millions of cases and deaths have been averted since 2000 through the scale-up of effective interventions.Having said that, I am concerned that we have become complacent and expect progress to continue at the same levels of funding. Since 2013, the rate of progress has either slowed or stalled in many malaria-endemic countries. We have an opportunity
                to double down our efforts, and it is not just about increasing financing. It also means better and smarter ways to invest available resources. Closing gaps in coverage of the tools that we know work is absolutely critical, as is continued
                investment in the research and development of new tools."
Do I need to pay to participate in the scheme?,"Participation in the scheme is currently free of charge; the laboratory simply has to cover any costs associated with the reception of the panels (e.g. customs charges, travel to nearest airport) and the testing itself.However, to ensure the long-term sustainability of the scheme, the implementation of a participation fee is planned for the near future to cover at least part of the running costs of the scheme. The fee will be determined based on a dedicated cost estimation model."
What is the composition of the EQA panels?,"Currently, the panel includes 10 lyophilized blood (LB) and 10 dried blood spot (DBS) samples. Malaria-containing samples have varying parasite densities, ranging from 50 to 2 000 000 parasites per microliter of blood (p/mL). Parasite-positive samples can be from any of the five species known to infect humans, i.e. P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. malariae, P. ovale or P. knowlesi, depending on availability. The lyophilized and DBS samples do not share the same composition, i.e. different species and/or parasite densities can be included."
How are the panels prepared?,"Briefly, parasites are obtained either through in vitro culture of laboratory strains – in the case of P. falciparum and P. knowlesi – or by using leftover blood from clinical samples. Parasite-negative blood for negative control samples and for the dilution of parasites is obtained from accredited blood banks and pre-screened by PCR to confirm the absence of Plasmodium parasites.After determining the densities of the cultured or clinical parasite samples by expert microscopy, they are diluted with parasite-negative blood to parasite densities ranging from 50 to 2 000 000 p/mL. Samples are mixed thoroughly at each dilution step. To prepare LB samples, dilutions are then aliquoted in 500 µL volumes and lyophilized. To prepare DBS samples, 50 µL volumes are deposited on Protein Saver 903 DBS cards and air-dried for 3–4 hours. All samples are stored at -80°C for long-term storage, but can be shipped and transported at ambient temperature.A more detailed description of the preparation procedures can be found in the Operational Manual of the WHO NAAT EQA scheme, version 1.0."
What method should I use for testing the panels?,"Each laboratory should test the panels using the extraction and amplification methods that it routinely uses for testing clinical or research study samples. Laboratories are permitted to submit only one result per sample. Laboratories are requested to provide information on the methods used, such as the test’s name or kit details, along with their final result in the online results submission form. Repeat testing should only be done in the case of indeterminate results or suspicion of methodological errors, just as would be done routinely for any clinical or research study sample."
What if I get substandard scoring results?,"An incident review form is available online from the UK NEQAS website. Laboratories receiving substandard results should complete this form and send it to the scheme manager at parasit@ukneqas.org.uk, with copy to the WHO contact at MalNAATEQA@who.int. Laboratories can also request a repeat panel to be shipped for re-testing and further investigation, at the same e-mail addresses. Additional remote technical support is currently provided by FIND (until 30 June 2018) and by members of the WHO Advisory Group and/or representatives of the referee laboratories if their time and workload allow. It is the participating laboratory’s right to decide if its EQA results can be shared with these third-party sources of technical support, as well as other information such as instruments or reagents used and results from any repeat or troubleshooting experiments generated through this investigational process.It is the participating laboratory’s right to decide if its EQA results can be shared with these third-party sources of technical support, as well as other information such as instruments or reagents used and results from any repeat or troubleshooting experiments generated through this investigational process.From time to time, webinars will be organized to give registered laboratories the opportunity to ask questions from a panel of experts in the field of molecular-based malaria diagnostics.Ultimately, it is the laboratory’s responsibility to investigate and address any problems. Sponsors of the laboratory should consider allocating appropriate resources to improve the quality management system (QMS) of the laboratory, as required."
Are results kept confidential?,"Yes. All testing results are kept strictly confidential; only the laboratory itself can access them through the UK NEQAS webportal using its specific login and password. Otherwise, only staff from the scheme’s organizing team can access individual results for the purposes of data analysis and reporting. Only anonymized and aggregated results will be used for publication or communication to the scheme’s Advisory Group.If substandard results require any remedial action or technical support, the scheme organizers will first seek the laboratory’s interest and approval to involve any third parties such as technical staff from FIND or members of the Advisory Group. If the laboratory agrees, test results will then be communicated to facilitate troubleshooting and remediation."
Can I communicate my results to others?,"Each laboratory is free to communicate part or all of its testing results to any third party without the need to inform WHO or UK NEQAS. Communication of the scheme results is encouraged in order to confirm the laboratory’s performance level for potential collaborators, donors, regulatory authorities and others. Communication of substandard results is also encouraged in order to seek assistance or funding for training workshops, and to work on improving the laboratory’s performance."
How can I get help if facing problems with the webpage?,"Participants can send an e-mail to the UK NEQAS scheme manager at parasit@ukneqas.org.uk, with a description of the problem, screenshots or other useful information."
How can I get help to improve my performance?,"As described under the question ‘what if I get substandard results’, the laboratory can request a repeat panel to be shipped for re-testing and further investigation of the reasons behind the bad results. Repeat panels can be requested by contacting the scheme manager at parasit@ukneqas.org.uk, with copy to the WHO contact at MalNAATEQA@who.int. Remote technical support can also be offered by FIND (until 30 June 2018) and/or staff from the referee laboratories of the scheme and the WHO Advisory Group, depending on availability.It is nevertheless the laboratory’s responsibility to work on improving its performance and solving any quality issues. Therefore, other options should also be considered, including participating in training workshops, working with collaborating laboratories, investing in an improved QMS, and so on."
What happens if I drop a specimen vial by mistake?,"If a specimen vial from the EQA panel set gets damaged, dropped or lost for some reason, the scheme can send repeat specimens. For this, the laboratory can simply contact the scheme manager at parasit@ukneqas.org.uk, with copy to the WHO contact at MalNAATEQA@who.int, explaining the reason for the request and specifying how many vials of which specimen are required. As the scheme is run with limited funding, this offer of repeat specimens should be used sparingly, only in the case of real need."
Is the WHO NAAT EQA scheme accredited to any ISO standards?,"The WHO NAAT EQA scheme is conducted at the same quality standard as UK NEQAS’s own molecular malaria scheme. UK NEQAS holds a UKAS accreditation in accordance with ISO 17043: 2010, which means that all laboratory procedures, processes, infrastructure, staff, data, documents etc. are managed according to well-defined procedures and at a high level of quality, as defined by the ISO 17043: 2010 standard."
What is sleeping sickness?,"Sleeping sickness, also called ""human African trypanosomiasis"",
 is a widespread tropical disease that can be fatal if not treated. It 
is spread by the bite of an infected tsetse fly (Glossina Genus),
 a species native to the African continent. More than sixty million 
people who live mainly in rural parts of East, West and Central Africa 
are at risk of contracting sleeping sickness.
		The tsetse fly bite erupts into a red sore and within a few 
weeks the person can experience fever, swollen lymph glands, aching 
muscles and joints, headaches and irritability. In advanced stages, the 
disease attacks the central nervous system and people present with 
changes in personality, alteration of the biological clock (the 
circadian rhythm), confusion, slurred speech, seizures and difficulty in
 walking and talking. These problems can develop over many years and if 
not treated, the person dies.   The main approaches to controlling African trypanosomiasis are
 to reduce the reservoirs of infection and the presence of the tsetse 
fly. Screening of people at risk helps identify patients at an early 
stage. Diagnosis should be made as early as possible and before the 
advanced stage to avoid complicated, difficult and risky treatment 
procedures."
What is TB? How does it spread? How is it treated?,"Tuberculosis (TB) is caused by bacteria (Mycobacterium tuberculosis) that most often affect the lungs. Tuberculosis is curable and preventable.
		TB is spread from person to person through the air. When 
people with lung TB cough, sneeze or spit, they propel the TB germs into
 the air. A person needs to inhale only a few of these germs to become 
infected.About one-third of the world's population has latent TB, which
 means people have been infected by TB bacteria but are not (yet) ill 
with disease and cannot transmit the disease.People infected with TB bacteria have a lifetime risk of 
falling ill with TB of 10%. However persons with compromised immune 
systems, such as people living with HIV, malnutrition or diabetes, or 
people who use tobacco, have a much higher risk of falling ill.When a person develops active TB (disease), the symptoms 
(cough, fever, night sweats, weight loss etc.) may be mild for many 
months. This can lead to delays in seeking care, and results in 
transmission of the bacteria to others. People ill with TB can infect up
 to 10-15 other people through close contact over the course of a year. 
Without proper treatment up to two thirds of people ill with TB will 
die.Since 2000, 53 million lives have been saved through effective
 diagnosis and treatment. Active, drug-sensitive TB disease is treated 
with a standard 6-month course of 4 antimicrobial drugs that are 
provided with information, supervision and support to the patient by a 
health worker or trained volunteer. The vast majority of TB cases can be
 cured when medicines are provided and taken properly."
Why should I check my hearing?,Many people with hearing loss are unaware of it. Regular hearing checks can ensure that hearing loss is identified as early as possible so that you can take action and continue enjoying the sounds around you.
Who is at risk of hearing loss?,"Any one is at risk of hearing loss, however, hearing loss is most likely to occur in people who:

are above 60 years of age
listen often to loud music
work in noisy environments
take medicines that can damage the ear"
"The test told me to get professional advice, but I can hear well. What does it mean?","Hearing loss means a reduction in the ability to hear. There are different grades of hearing loss:

Mild: some difficulty in understanding soft speech or speech in noisy places
Moderate: difficulty in hearing regular conversations
Severe: difficulty in hearing all except loud sounds
Profound: inability to hear even loud sounds"
How can hearing loss affect my life?,"If hearing loss is not addressed, it can affect people in different ways: children might have difficulties learning; adults might have challenges performing at work and older people might experience isolation and uneasiness. In general, if it is not addressed, hearing loss can make it difficult to understand conversations and fully engage socially. Read the factsheet for more information.

Factsheet"
Can listening to music affect my ears?,"Listening to loud music for long periods tires and damages sensory cells within your ears. At first you might experience just temporary hearing loss, which manifests as muffled sounds or a ringing sensation in the ear (tinnitus). Over time, it causes permanent damage with irreversible hearing loss and tinnitus."
How should I care for my ears?,"You can care for your ears by:

Making sure that you never insert any object into your ear (not even a cotton swab)
Keeping the volume low and limiting the time spent listening (find additional information in the link below)
Using earplugs in noisy places or when doing noisy activities
Visiting a doctor in case of any pain or discharge from the ear
Seeking help from a health care professional, if you feel that you may not be hearing well or have tinnitus

Information on safe listening"
How is hearing loss diagnosed?,"A professional hearing assessment is required to diagnose hearing loss. A very common test is the audiometry - it identifies the minimum sound level (in decibels) at which you can hear different sound frequencies (pitch). It is used to identify the presence, type and grade of hearing loss. The hearWHO app uses a different test to diagnose hearing loss."
What happens if I get hearing loss?,"The management of hearing loss depends upon its cause, type and grade. You should consult a health care professional who can advise you about the most suitable interventions."
I don’t know where to get my hearing tested? What shall I do?,"A hearing test is likely to be available at a medical facility such as a secondary or tertiary level hospital. If you are not sure, it would be best to ask a health care professional about where such a test can be done."
How does hearWHO help?,"The hearWHO app is based on digits-in-noise hearing screening technology. The screening presents three digits over background noise, to which you are prompted to respond. The screening determines your signal to noise ratio which is indicative of your hearing ability. Should you not receive a favourable outcome from this screening, you should seek medical attention from a health care professional."
How accurate is hearWHO?,"This ‘digits-in-noise’ test has a sensitivity and specificity of over 85%.* However, WHO and the developers of this app cannot be held responsible or liable for any incorrect results. hearWHO is intended for use by people 18 years of age and above. This version of the hearWHO app is not for use for hearing checks for children, as it will not provide reliable results.

"If I adjust my device to a higher comfortable volume, will my hearing score improve?","No, the test evaluates your ability to hear speech in background noise. As long as the speech is at a comfortable listening level, the volume should not affect the outcome."
What happens if I make lucky guesses? Won’t that give me a wrong score?,The test has been developed and normed according to the instruction to guess if you are uncertain. The chances of correctly guessing several digits in a closed set of 10 options are highly unlikely.
Why does the test include 23 sets of digits? Why not more or less?,This has been one of the standard test development approaches for digits-in-noise testing across several countries. It ensures a sufficient number of trials for a reliable speech reception threshold.
What lessons does influenza preparedness offer for tackling respiratory pathogens and other diseases?,"Capacity building for influenza is critical because if you can prepare for and respond to flu outbreaks or respiratory events, you learn and practice for responses to other emerging diseases.Flu is not a sporadic outbreak like Ebola or Zika. It is always there, so there is always something to practice with and keep skills sharp. Because flu is a continual threat there is a lot of learning that goes on which also supports work on other emerging diseases. It’s like the basic architecture for capacity building in all areas. For example, you can practice your communications for responding to outbreaks and better understand the behavioral aspects of vaccine hesitancy. You can build your laboratory capacity and surveillance and response capacity and use it for other things infectious threats such as MERS or SARS or other respiratory threats. Influenza can also help you learn how to implement a vaccine programme and introduce new drugs. All these things, if you put them in place for flu, will help build capacity for a broad spectrum of outbreaks."
"Can you give an example of a country that established an influenza-monitoring programme, which was then used for other diseases?","In Africa, when we started in 2006, there were only about five countries that had capacity to monitor influenza and process flu samples. Now, in the last ten years, after we started building capacity, there are about 25 countries that routinely conduct flu work. When the 2009 pandemic came, many of them were ready to diagnose the first cases through their newly established flu surveillance programmes.We also embarked on a global rapid response-training programme where we trained more than 100 countries, including many in Africa. Later we heard that they were using the flu outbreak response teams in their response to Rift Valley Fever, to Ebola, and other outbreaks.

There are still places we can improve surveillance, in Africa, in central Asia. There are little pockets everywhere."
Is there a long-term plan to help the world prepare for influenza?,"WHO and partners are developing a “Global Strategy for Influenza” to be launched in 2018. In accordance with the WHO’s Thirteen 13th Global Programme of Work (GPW13), which draws on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and efforts to strengthen health systems to achieve Universal Health Coverage (UHC), the new strategy will support WHO Member States in developing seasonal influenza prevention and control capacities. These efforts, in turn, will build greater preparedness for the next pandemic. The strategy focuses on three priorities, strengthening pandemic preparedness, expanding seasonal influenza prevention and control and research and innovation.  Research and innovation includes improved modelling and forecasting of influenza outbreaks, along with the development of new vaccines, including a possible universal influenza vaccine that would work against all influenza virus strains."
What is trans fat?,"Trans fat, or trans-fatty acids, are unsaturated fatty acids that come from either natural or industrial sources. Naturally-occurring trans fat come from ruminants (cows and sheep). Industrially-produced trans fat are formed in an industrial process that adds hydrogen to vegetable oil converting the liquid into a solid, resulting in “partially hydrogenated” oil (PHO)."
What is the health impact of consuming foods that contain trans fat?,"Approximately 540,000 deaths each year can be attributed to intake of industrially produced trans-fatty acids.1 High trans fat intake increases the risk of death from any cause by 34%, coronary heart disease deaths by 28%, and coronary heart disease by
    21%.2 This is likely due to the effect on lipid levels: trans fat increases LDL (“bad”) cholesterol levels while lowering HDL (“good”) cholesterol levels.2, 3 Trans fat has no known health benefits."
Is natural trans fat harmful as well?,"The effect on blood lipids resulting from changes in ruminant or industrially-produced trans fat appear to be similar.4 International expert groups and public health authorities recommend limiting consumption of trans fat (industrially-produced and ruminant) to less than 1% of total energy intake, which translates to less than 2.2 g/day for a 2,000-calorie diet."
Why are partially hydrogenated oils used in food?,Partially hydrogenated oils (PHO) are solid at room temperature and prolong the shelf life of products. They are primarily used for deep frying and as an ingredient in baked goods. PHOs were first introduced into the food supply in the early 20th century as a replacement for butter and lard; they are not a natural part of the human diet and are fully replaceable
Which foods contain industrially-produced trans fat?,"Partially hydrogenated oils (PHO) are the main source of industrially-produced trans fat. PHO is an ingredient in many foods, including margarine, vegetable shortening, and Vanaspati ghee; fried foods and doughnuts; baked goods such as crackers, biscuits, and pies; and pre-mixed products such as pancake and hot chocolate mix. Baked and fried street and restaurant foods often contain industrially-produced trans fat. All of these products can be made without industrially-produced trans fat."
How much trans fat do people consume?,"The average consumption of trans fat globally was estimated to be 1.4% of total energy in 2010, ranging from 0.2 to 6.5% of total energy across countries (0.13 to 4.3 grams per day for a 2,000-calorie diet).5 According to the available information, which is limited, the highest intake was in North America, Latin America and North Africa/Middle East, and intakes were generally higher at younger ages.5 Between 1990 and 2010, global trans fat intake is believed to have remained stable.5"
What were the key elements to Paraguay’s malaria elimination success that helped the country reach zero indigenous cases of the disease?,"Paraguay is the first country in the Americas since Cuba in 1973 to be certified malaria-free, representing a significant public health achievement not only for Paraguay but for the Americas as a whole. Achieving elimination in Paraguay required substantial
    levels of political commitment and leadership, as well as sustained investments in its national malaria programme over a period spanning more than 50 years. Notable aspects of its approach include:Rapid and targeted responseWith free universal health services in Paraguay and a strong malaria surveillance system, malaria cases were detected early, investigated promptly and classified correctly.Dedicated elimination strategyAfter reporting its last case of malaria in 2011, Paraguay launched a 5-year plan to consolidate the gains, prevent re-establishment of transmission and prepare for elimination certification. Activities centred on strengthening epidemiological surveillance,
    robust case management, and a public information campaign on the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of malaria to promote behaviour change among populations in at-risk areas.IntegrationDuring 2015 and 2016, as part of a broader health reform, malaria surveillance, diagnosis and treatment activities were integrated within Paraguay’s general health services, with the aim of expanding health coverage to at-risk populations and preventing
    re-establishment.
Strengthening surveillance skillsA 3-year initiative to hone the skills of front-line health workers in the country’s 18 health regions was launched in 2016 to keep the malaria surveillance system sustainable over the long term. Supported by The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis
    and Malaria, the project addresses disease prevention, identification of suspected cases, accurate diagnosis and prompt treatment to respond to the on-going threat of malaria importation from endemic countries in the region and Africa."
How has Paraguay managed to stay malaria-free since 2012? What are the systems in place that made this possible and how long will the country keep those systems operational?,"As part of the WHO elimination certification process, countries must demonstrate that they have the capacity to prevent the re-establishment of malaria transmission. The availability of free universal health services in Paraguay and a strong malaria surveillance system ensure imported cases of malaria are detected and responded to in a timely manner to prevent local transmission.The inclusion of the national malaria programme within the National Malaria Eradication Service (SENEPA, in the Spanish acronym), the institution within the ministry of health responsible for the control of vector-borne diseases, helps guarantee the programme’s future existence.Further, congressional legislation provides predictable and long-term financing for the national malaria programme: by law, 1.5% of annual income from Paraguay’s social security programme is allocated to SENEPA. Together, these elements ensure that efforts to prevent the re-establishment of malaria transmission can be sustained in the decades to come."
What are the benefits of malaria elimination for Paraguay?,"Eliminating malaria in Paraguay means that no one will fall ill or die from local transmission of the disease, bringing about tangible health benefits at the individual and community levels, as well as broader socio-economic outcomes."
"What role did national leadership, political will, civil society and international partners play in Paraguay’s success?","Eliminating malaria is a collective effort, requiring the sustained engagement of many partners at the national, regional and global levels. However, achieving elimination is a country-driven process. For elimination efforts to succeed, government stewardship is essential, together with the engagement and participation of affected communities."
Does Paraguay coordinate cross-border surveillance activities to prevent importation of malaria cases and do they provide antimalarial treatment to visitors and migrants?,"Paraguay provides free treatment to all citizens, visitors and migrants, regardless of their nationality or residency status. The national malaria programme has identified three populations at greatest risk: the military, Brazilian students attending universities in Paraguay and Paraguayans travelling to Africa. Targeted interventions include strengthening passive detection systems, promotion of health education, and providing prophylaxis to travellers heading to and returning from malaria-endemic regions in Africa.To step up cross-border collaboration, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) funded a project focused on strengthening entomological surveillance and control of vector-borne diseases in the ‘triple border’ area of Argentina, Brazil and Paraguay. A key outcome of the project, which ran from 2010 to 2012, was the development of an Anophelesmosquito range map, a tool that shows the geographic distribution of malaria-carrying mosquitoes."
What are the lessons learned from Paraguay’s experience that can be applied in other countries looking to eliminate malaria?,"Paraguay provides universal free health services to all, one of the critical elements that helps drive a country towards malaria elimination. Sustained political commitment and robust financial support are further keys to success. Continued surveillance of suspected cases, targeted community engagement and education, as well as strengthening skills of front-line health workers, are recommended strategies that WHO encourages countries to adopt as part of their national malaria elimination programmes."
Is Paraguay replicating its elimination strategy with other infectious and mosquito-borne diseases?,"Paraguay has an integrated approach to entomological surveillance activities, taking into account several vector-borne diseases including dengue, leishmaniasis and Zika virus. Integration of malaria surveillance into the general health system had been a challenging task in Paraguay, but the lessons and experiences learned from other vector-borne diseases have contributed to the smooth integration and transition of the malaria programme. At the same time, the approach used to eliminate malaria is now being applied to eliminate Chagas disease and schistosomiasis."
What is the best way to monitor industrially-produced trans fat?,"Monitoring the trans fat content in foods and the change over time is critical for establishing baseline levels of trans fat, measuring compliance with current regulations (if any), measuring the impact of regulations on the trans fat and saturated fatty acids (SFA) content of foods over time, and assessing the need for expanded regulations. Measuring population trans fat intake can help define the scope of the problem and evaluate the impact of regulations on trans fat consumption"
What is the best way to measure population trans fat intake?,"Assessing intake of trans fat should be done through population surveys. Potential methods include dietary surveys (food frequency questionnaires or 24 hour dietary recall) or blood plasma/serum assays. Dietary surveys require an up-to-date nutrition database that includes the trans fat content of food. Measuring trans fat intake through collection of blood serum/plasma, a relatively new method, doesn’t require detailed food supply data and can be used to track exposure to trans fat over time.6,7 It can also be used to validate changes seen in the food supply. Surveys may need to use purposive sampling to identify populations with the highest consumption of trans fat rather than simply determining average daily consumption."
What is the best way to measure the trans fat content of foods?,"Measuring the amount of trans fat in foods requires an understanding of the key sources of trans fat in the food supply. Products that represent the key sources of trans fat from all sectors (fats/oils, packaged foods, restaurant food, food in the informal sector) should be sampled, analyzed for trans fat contents, and recorded in a database. Where available, nutrition labels should also be reviewed for trans fat and saturated fatty acid (SFA) content and documented in the database.Monounsaturated fatty-acids (MUFA) and polyunsaturated fatty-acids (PUFA) should also be measured and recorded to understand what is replacing trans fat."
Is there a standard amount of trans fat in partially hydrogenated oils or does it vary widely across oils?,"The trans fat content of partially hydrogenated oils (PHO) can vary from 10-60% of the oil, depending on how the oil is manufactured, with an average trans fat content of 25-45% of the oil.8"
Does frying or heating oil create trans fat?,"There is evidence that heating and frying oil at high temperatures leads to modest increases in trans fat concentrations.9-14 On average, the level of trans fat has been found to increase by 3.67 g/100g after heating, and by 3.57 g/100g after frying.9 There is no evidence that other cooking methods, e.g. baking, boiling and grilling, lead to increased trans fat concentrations.15, 16"
Why not target heating and frying if it creates trans fat?,"The amount of trans fat generated during heating and frying is low when compared with the amount of trans fat in partially hydrogenated oils (PHO). On average, trans fat concentrations in PHOs are 25-45% of the oil,8  where heating and frying only increases trans fat concentrations by approximately 3%.9"
What healthy oils should be used instead?,"The removal of partially hydrogenated oils (PHO) results in substantial health benefits, with the greatest advantage obtained when PHOs are replaced by oils rich in polyunsaturated fatty- acids (PUFA), followed by oils rich in monounsaturated fatty-acids (MUFA).3 Oils rich in PUFAs include safflower oil, corn oil, sunflower oil, soybean oil, fatty fish, walnuts, and seeds; oils rich in  MUFAs include canola oil, olive oil, peanut oil, and oils from nuts and avocados. The choices of fats and oils used in many countries will be influenced by availability, cost of the replacement alternatives and the oil industry’s capacity to innovate."
Why should governments prioritize eliminating trans fat from the food supply?,Replacing trans fat with healthier oils/fats in the food supply is a low-cost way for governments to save the lives of their citizens.  Experiences in several countries demonstrate that industrially-produced trans fat can be replaced by healthier oils.  Costs to implement best practice interventions (i.e. regulatory limits on trans fat) are likely well under the commonly accepted thresholds of cost-effectiveness.17 Modelling from the United Kingdom found five-year net savings in healthcare costs.18  WHO recommends trans fat elimination as a cost-effective intervention for low- and middle- income countries. Governments can eliminate the cause of 7% of cardiovascular disease globally with a low-cost investment.
What is REPLACE?,"REPLACE is an action package developed by the World Health Organization (WHO) that supports governments to ensure the prompt, complete, and sustained elimination of industrially-produced trans fat from the food supply. The practical, 6-step package calls for the promotion of use and consumption of healthier fats and oils, the elimination of industrially-produced trans fats, to be achieved through regulatory actions, while establishing solid monitoring systems and creating awareness among policy-makers, producers, suppliers, and the public."
Why support legislation/regulation rather than a voluntary approach?,"Experiences in several countries demonstrate that mandatory approaches are much more effective than voluntary approaches to reducing trans fat in the food supply and in the population.19 In New York City, voluntary efforts to reduce trans fat exposure by asking restaurants to use other products had no impact after a one-year intervention, and regulatory action to ban trans fat resulted in rapid and near-complete elimination.20 In six countries in south-eastern Europe with voluntary trans fat reduction, high concentrations of industrially-produced trans fat were still present in many different brands of biscuits, cakes and wafers after 2 years.21  Additionally, voluntary reformulation has led to reduced trans fat levels disproportionately across food categories. Some countries have had successes with voluntary measures leading to reductions in trans fat in the food supply, notably Canada, the Netherlands and the UK. 22, 23"
What countries have successfully eliminated trans fat?,"There are very few countries with high-quality data available on trans fat contents of the food supply. Denmark has been monitoring the trans fat contents in foods for the last 30 years, and virtual elimination of industrially-produced trans fat has been achieved.24 According to a recent review of trans fat intake globally, average national trans fat intake is below 1% of total energy (the international recommendation) in Australia, Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Iceland, Ireland, Mexico, Norway, Poland, Sweden, The Netherlands and the United Kingdom.25 However, it is unclear if significant proportions of the population still consume more than 1% of total energy from trans fat. There is a clear need for more countries to monitor trans fat in the food supply and population consumption."
What is the best practice for fully eliminating trans fat?,"Mandatory national limits on industrially-produced trans fat are the most effective way to reduce trans fat in the food supply.19 There are two primary models for mandatory limits. The first, pioneered in Denmark, limits industrially-produced trans fat to no more than 2 grams/100 grams of total fat/oils in all foods, and applies to domestic and imported products. The second model, recently adopted by the United States and Canada and going into effect in mid-2018, reclassifies PHO (the source of industrially-produced trans fat) as an unsafe food additive (US) or a contaminant or other adulterating substance in food (Canada26), essentially banning industrially-produced trans fat.Most countries that have passed regulations or legislation followed the Denmark model, including Austria, Chile, Ecuador, Hungary, Iceland, Norway, Singapore, and South Africa. Latvia, Slovenia, and Sweden have passed similar limits that have not yet gone into effect. Argentina, Colombia, Iran and Switzerland have similar restrictions in effect, with 2% trans fat limits in fats and oils plus, in the case of Argentina and Colombia, 5% trans fat limits in fats and oils for other foods. India has limits of 5% trans fat content in some fats and oils."
What support is needed for industry to successfully eliminate industrially-produced trans fat?,"Regulatory measures should be accompanied by government support to industry, including education and technical assistance to support reformulation using polyunsaturated fatty acids and monounsaturated fatty acids instead of tropic oils and animal fats. In many cases, tropical vegetable oils high in saturated fatty acids (SFA) are the least expensive and most accessible alternative oils, so government technical support is particularly important for small and medium-sized enterprises. Government support can include: subsidies, e.g. removing subsidies on PHOs and tropical oils high in SFA; introducing agricultural policies to reduce cost and increase availability of healthy oil alternatives; and funding for innovation research on healthy replacement oils. Argentina is a good example of government working with industry to increase the supply of healthy alternatives.22"
How does nutrition labelling support reducing trans fat intake?,"Including saturated fatty acid (SFA) and trans fat content on packaged food nutrition labels allows monitoring of compliance with mandatory trans fat limits and concomitant changes in SFA. Labelling provides a foundation for either voluntary programs to limit trans fat or local/national laws or regulation. Coupled with consumer education, media attention and advocacy, labelling can lead to reformulation, as in the United States. However, it is unlikely to lead to the full elimination of trans fat in the food supply.27 Almost 10 years after labelling was mandated in the United States and Canada, regulations are being put in place to ban partially hydrogenated oils from the food supply. While including trans fat levels on labels is important, health claims such as “trans fat free” should not be allowed unless other specific food criteria are met; single nutrient claims can be used to increase the market appeal of unhealthy foods high in sugar, salt or saturated fat. The effectiveness of labelling regulations may be limited in low- and middle- income countries, where the main source of trans fats is often food purchased from street vendors rather than packaged food.19"
Are trans fat policies enforceable?,"Yes, trans fat policies can be enforced. There is evidence to
support effective strategies, and lessons from experiences in
more challenging contexts can be applied to ensure successful
policy implementation and monitoring. Countries with large
informal food sectors may be challenging, as they are difficult to
regulate. However, by mandating that the oil and fats industry
limit (or ban) trans fat content, the oils and fats available on
the market can help drive change in product formulation in the
informal food sector. Additionally, a trans fat monitoring system
including random tests in the formal and informal sectors can be
established, with specific penalties. There are models for sampling
and measuring trans fat in foods in the informal food sector from
eastern European countries.28"
What can advocates do to support trans fat elimination?,"Advocates have a big role to play in trans fat elimination in order
to spur both governments and industry to take action. Knowledge
of trans fat exposure, either based on surveys or measuring trans
fat in foods, has been catalytic and very useful to advocates.
For example, in Argentina, the media disseminated scientific
and practical information to the public on the harmful effects
of trans fat, catalyzing change and creating demand, resulting
in replacement of approximately 40% of the trans fats that
were produced annually with other fats.22 In Denmark, a 1993
landmark study published in The Lancet along with subsequent
government reports on the impact of trans fat in Denmark initiated
years of media attention, which led to public awareness and
industry support. In Canada, scientific findings found that Canada
had one of the highest average levels of trans fat intake in the
world (8.4 grams per day in 1995), leading to public concern
and government response. In addition, as trans fat regulations
generally do not specify the types of oils for trans fat replacement,
the role of advocating for healthy replacement oils (i.e. oils low in
saturated fatty acids and high monounsaturated fatty acids and
polyunsaturated fatty acids) is particularly important."
The WHO Expert Committee on Drug Dependence (ECDD) just held a special session on cannabis. Why is this important?,"It was the first time the WHO ECDD reviewed cannabis and cannabis-related
substances to consider the appropriateness of their current scheduling within the
International Drug Control ConventionsThe Committee, which met from 4-7 June 2018, conducted a pre-review of cannabis-related substances that are currently subject to international control: 
Cannabis plant (e.g. marijuana) and cannabis resin (e.g. hashish) Extracts and tinctures of cannabis (oils, edibles, liquids)
 Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) e.g. dronabinol
Isomers of THCThe ECCD also conducted a critical review of preparations considered to be pure
cannabidiol (CBD), a major component of the plant."
What is the difference between a pre-review and a critical review?,"A pre-review is the first step of the ECDD’s assessment process, where it is determined
whether there is enough robust scientific information to proceed to the next step, called
a critical review. This initial evaluation is also an opportunity to identify gaps in the
available scientific data.
A critical review is carried out when there is sufficient scientific evidence to allow the
ECDD to make informed an recommendation that the substance be placed under
international control, or if its level of control should be changed.
Substances under control are regulated by the International Drug Control Conventions,
which restrict international production and trade of these substances. Individual
countries can exercise discretion in how they will apply controls within their territories.
This is why the use of cannabis for medical purposes is legalised in some countries,
while it is not in others."
What did the ECDD decide?,"The Committee made two main decisions:  There was sufficient evidence to proceed to a critical review of cannabis and
related substances at the next ECDD meeting in November 2018. The ECDD recommended that preparations considered to be pure cannabidiol
(CBD) not be placed under international drug control as the substance was not
found to have psychoactive properties, and presents no potential for abuse or
dependence."
Does this mean that cannabis-related substances should be available for medical use?,"The ECDD is an independent group of experts in the field of drug dependence
convened by WHO. Its role is not to recommend the use of substances for medical
treatment, but rather to advise on the scheduling of substances based on evaluations of
potential for harm, dependence and abuse from a public health perspective, as well as
their therapeutic usefulness. WHO then makes recommendations to the UN Secretary General, and the decision
whether to adopt the recommendations is subject to a vote by the UN Commission on
Narcotic Drugs."
What information did the ECDD consider when making their decisions?,"WHO commissioned reviews of each cannabis-related substance from scientific experts
in five different disciplines: chemistry, pharmacology, toxicology, epidemiology, and
therapeutic use. The experts were selected through a rigorous screening process in
accordance with WHO procurement guidelines and on the basis of demonstrated
extensive knowledge of and expertise in the subject. Selection criteria were also
designed to ensure balanced geographic and gender representation. In accordance with
WHO policy, all experts were asked to disclose potential conflicts of interest. All Member States were invited to submit relevant information to the ECDD through a
specially designed questionnaire to gather insights into the legitimate use, harmful use,
status of national control, and potential impact of international control for each
substance under evaluation. 
The ECDD meeting also included an Open Session at which representatives of civil
society, patient groups, academics and commercial parties had the opportunity to share
their views and experiences regarding the uses of cannabis for the Committee’s
consideration."
Why had cannabis never been reviewed until now?,"The ECDD acts in accordance with International Drug Control Conventions that identify
criteria to schedule or propose rescheduling of substances under control. Within these
Conventions, there has until recently been limited robust scientific information about the 
Page 3 of 3
health effects of cannabis for the ECDD to consider its review. As more Member States
permit the use of cannabis for medical and non-medical purposes, more evidence is
emerging about their health effects. The ECDD determined that there is now enough
information to conduct a full review of cannabis and its related substances."
When is the ECDD expected to make its recommendations on the scheduling of cannabis?,"The next ECDD meeting will be held in November 2018. At that time, the Committee
will undertake critical reviews of cannabis and related substances. 
The meeting will also be an opportunity to review several New Psychoactive
Substances (NPS) like synthetic cannabinoids and fentanyl-analogues, as well as
medicines such as tramadol and pregabalin. * The ECDD is an independent group of experts in the field of drug dependence convened by WHO to
review the potential for abuse, dependence and harm to health of psychoactive substances. The
Committee makes recommendations on whether or not psychoactive substances should be placed under
international control or if their level of control should be changed. The recommendations are then
presented by the Director General of WHO to the UN Secretary General and the United Nations
Commission on Narcotic Drugs (CND)."
What is gaming disorder?,"Gaming disorder is defined in the 11th Revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11) as a pattern of gaming behavior (“digital-gaming” or “video-gaming”) characterized by impaired control over gaming, increasing priority given to gaming over other activities to the extent that gaming takes precedence over other interests and daily activities, and continuation or escalation of gaming despite the occurrence of negative consequences.For gaming disorder to be diagnosed, the behaviour pattern must be of sufficient severity to result in significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning and would normally have been evident for at least 12 months."
What is the International Classification of Diseases?,The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) is the basis for identification of health trends and statistics globally and the international standard for reporting diseases and health conditions. It is used by medical practitioners around the world to diagnose conditions and by researchers to categorize conditions.The inclusion of a disorder in ICD is a consideration which countries take into account when planning public health strategies and monitoring trends of disorders.WHO released the 11th revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11) in mid-2018.
Why is gaming disorder being included in ICD-11?,"A decision on inclusion of gaming disorder in ICD-11 is based on reviews of available evidence and reflects a consensus of experts from different disciplines and geographical regions that were involved in the process of technical consultations undertaken by WHO in the process of ICD-11 development. The inclusion of gaming disorder in ICD-11 follows the development of treatment programmes for people with health conditions identical to those characteristic of gaming disorder in many parts of the world,  and will result in the increased attention of health professionals to the risks of development of this disorder and, accordingly, to relevant prevention and treatment measures."
Should all people who engage in gaming be concerned about developing gaming disorder?,"Studies suggest that gaming disorder affects only a small proportion of people who engage in digital- or video-gaming activities. However, people who partake in gaming should be alert to the amount of time they spend on gaming activities,  particularly when it is to the exclusion of other daily activities, as well as to any changes in their physical or psychological health and social functioning that could be attributed to their pattern of gaming behaviour."
What is the M72/AS01E vaccine candidate?,"M72/AS01E is a subunit vaccine comprised of an immunogenic fusion protein (M72) derived from two Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) antigens (MTB32A and MTB39A), and the GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) proprietary adjuvant AS01E. AS01E is the same adjuvant used in Shingrix GSK vaccine, as well as in the new malaria vaccine RTS,S/AS01E."
Who developed and who manufactured the vaccine?,"The M72/AS01E vaccine candidate is being developed by the pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline, in partnership with AERAS. AERAS is a not for profit organization based in the US, aimed at supporting tuberculosis vaccine research, funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates foundation, the UK Department for International Development (DFID), and other organizations."
What is the role of WHO in this trial?,WHO was not involved in the design or implementation of this trial.
What is the Phase IIb trial on M72/AS01E designed to do?,"The purpose of this ongoing study is to evaluate the safety, immunogenicity and protective efficacy of M72/AS01E vaccine against pulmonary TB, as compared to placebo in HIV negative adults with latent TB infection living in high TB burden countries (South Africa, Kenya and Zambia) and aged 18 - 50 years. The study remains ongoing and the final analysis is planned in 2019. What is the trial design and the current statusThis was a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial participating 3573 HIV negative adults (18-50 years old) in Southern Africa (2873 from South Africa, 162 from Zambia, 538 from Kenya) who had evidence of Mtb infection at baseline (IGRA+) vaccinated with M72/AS01E or placebo on a 2 dose schedule administered at 1 month interval. The primary endpoint was the development of pulmonary TB. This was a case driven analysis, where analysis was triggered by the accrual of a certain number of pulmonary TB cases. While the primary analysis has now been released1 , the study is ongoing, with a final descriptive analysis planned for release in 2019. 
Can the vaccine cause unpleasant or dangerous reactions in people who have been vaccinated?Individuals vaccinated with M72/AS01E experienced more local and flu-like general reactions than placebo recipients. There were no other concerning safety imbalances between the study groups. The study is still blinded at the individual level. Full unblinding of the safety data is expected during the final analysis.  
 Efficacy resultsThe results showed that administering two-doses of M72/AS01E was successful in reducing the development of active TB disease with 54% efficacy (90% CI, 13.9 to 75.4; 95% CI, 2.9 to 78.2; P = 0.04) in HIV negative adults with latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. A total of 32 participants contributed to the primary vaccine efficacy analysis during 2 years of follow up: 10 participants vaccinated with M72/AS01E developed pulmonary TB, as compared to 22 participants in the placebo group"
How does the vaccine work?,"The exact mechanism of action of M72/AS01E is not known. Previous studies have showed that this vaccine induces an immune response characterized by the activation of interferon-gamma producing CD4+ T cells, and the production of antibodies. WHO strongly urges basic research to expand the current understanding of how this vaccine works, with a view to inform general understanding on the mechanisms of protection against tuberculosis."
Does this vaccine provide long-term or life-long protection?,The study has demonstrated protection approximately during two years of study follow up. The final analysis of the study is expected to provide data on protection during 3 years of follow-up. Further investigation is needed to provide information about protection beyond 3 years in different populations.
Is the efficacy reported adequate to have an impact on disease burden and spread?,"WHO has recently expressed a preference for a level of protection against tuberculosis in adults exceeding 50% efficacy to deliver impact. It will be important to determine whether the current vaccine also protects people who have not been infected with M.tb, across different geographical regions."
"Following last year’s World malaria report and its message that the global response to malaria has stalled, where are we in fighting this disease one year on?","The World malaria report 2018 reinforces the message that the world is currently not on track to achieve two critical 2020 milestones of the WHO Global Technical Strategy for Malaria 2016–2030 (GTS): reducing malaria deaths and disease by at least 40% by 2020. We are particularly concerned by the report’s finding that, in 2017, there were an estimated 3.5 million more cases of malaria in the 10 highest burden African countries. Of the countries hardest hit by malaria, only India showed progress in reducing its disease burden.Coverage of key interventions to prevent and treat malaria – such as insecticide treated nets (ITNs) and antimalarial medicines – has only marginally improved since 2015. Access to preventive therapies that protect pregnant women and children from malaria remains too low. And the burden of anaemia, especially among children who have malaria, remains unacceptably high.Read the World malaria report 2018 Read the Global Technical Strategy for Malaria 2016-2030"
Which findings in the World malaria report offer hope in getting the response back on track?,"Despite a levelling off in progress since 2015, the global malaria response is in a much better place than it was at the start of the century. There continue to be promising pockets of progress in countries that carry a high burden of malaria, such as India, where cases dropped by 24% in 2017 compared with 2016; in Rwanda, which recorded 430 000 fewer malaria cases in 2017 than in 2016; and in Ethiopia and Pakistan, where both countries has estimated decreases of more than 240 000 cases over the same period.The report also reveals that, in a subset of countries that are nearing elimination, the pace of progress is quickening. In 2017, for example, 46 countries reported fewer than 10 000 indigenous malaria cases, up from 37 countries in 2010, and for the first time, China and El Salvador reported zero indigenous cases. Earlier this year, WHO certified Paraguay as malaria-free, the first country in the Americas to be granted this status in 45 years."
Why are we not seeing more country-level progress in the malaria fight?,"The World malaria report presents a comprehensive snapshot of global progress and trends in fighting malaria. Identifying why a specific country is not advancing as hoped would require in-depth country-by-country assessments, which is not the purpose of this report. WHO is planning to lead country-focused analyses in the highest burden countries over the next year.At a glance, progress may have slowed for two reasons. First, funding for malaria control in most countries remains insufficient. The overall level of resources available in 2017, although slightly higher than in 2016, continues to fall short of our annual GTS funding target for 2020.Inadequate funding has resulted in major gaps in coverage of core malaria control tools that prevent, diagnose and treat malaria. In 2017, for example, an estimated half of the population at risk of malaria in Africa did not sleep under a treated net. Importantly, most ITNs distributed in recent years were used to replace old nets, resulting in limited quantities to cover additional populations."
Can the vaccine prevent the development of drug-resistant TB?,"This has not been evaluated in the present study. However, a vaccine protective against pulmonary tuberculosis in adults, if used widely, has the potential to reduce drug resistant tuberculosis by reducing transmission and preventing the need for antibiotics; essential steps for curbing anti-microbial resistance. The role of this candidate vaccine in limiting the development and spread of drug-resistant forms of TB disease should be further evaluated."
What is WHO’s interim position on the results?,"WHO commends the efforts conducted in partnership between GSK, AERAS, study investigators, study participants, and countries in bringing this result forward. 
The existing tuberculosis vaccine, BCG, is recommended for vaccination at birth to reduce the risk of severe forms of tuberculosis in children. While BCG provides moderate protection against severe forms of TB in infants and young children, it does not adequately protect adolescents and adults, who account for the majority of TB transmission. In this regard, these are very important findings in tuberculosis vaccine research. WHO with independent experts and formally constituted advisory committees will review the data and further assess the lessons for the field."
What should be the next steps?,"The study is still ongoing and a final analysis of the clinical data by the study sponsors is expected in 2019.  Once the final results are analyzed, WHO encourages the planning of a well-designed Phase III program. Various priorities can be highlighted, with a view to generate a more precise estimation of vaccine efficacy, in different geographical settings, and further evaluation of safety. The effect of vaccination should also be characterized in people who do not have latent infection, in children, and in specific risk groups such as persons infected with HIV. This will require adequate vaccine production and financing. WHO calls on all relevant stakeholders including pharma, funders, governments, civil society, health care practitioners, policy makers and international agencies to work in a sense of urgency, in spirit of collaboration and a sense of responsibility towards public health, to bring forward the expedited validation of this product in the fight against tuberculosis."
Eleven countries – 10 in sub-Saharan Africa and India – together accounted for the bulk of all malaria cases and deaths globally in 2017. What is being done to change the trajectory of the disease in these high burden countries?,"At the World Health Assembly in May 2018, the WHO Director-General, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, called for an aggressive new approach to jump-start progress against malaria. A new country-driven response – “High burden to high impact” – will be launched in Mozambique on 19 November, alongside the release of the World malaria report 2018.The approach will be driven by the 11 countries that carry the highest burden of the disease (Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ghana, India, Mali, Mozambique, Niger, Nigeria, Uganda and United Republic of Tanzania). Key elements of the new approach include:Political will to reduce the toll of malaria;Strategic information to drive impact;Better guidance, policies and strategies; andA coordinated national malaria response.Catalyzed by WHO and the RBM Partnership to End Malaria, “High burden to high impact” builds on the principle that no one should die from a disease that is preventable and treatable. The support and engagement of all partners will be critically important to the success of this country-led approach.Read High burden to high impact: a targeted malaria response"
"Of the 11 highest burden countries worldwide, India is the only one to have recorded a substantial decline in malaria cases in 2017. What is the reason behind this decline?","India – a country that accounted for 4% of global malaria cases in 2017 – is making significant progress in bringing down its malaria burden. As reflected in this year’s World malaria report, the country registered a 24% reduction in cases over 2016, largely due to substantial declines of the disease in the highly malarious state of Odisha, home to approximately 40% of all malaria cases in the country.Success factors include rejuvenated political commitment, strengthened technical leadership, which focused on prioritizing the right mix of vector control measures, and increased levels of domestic funding to back efforts. A notable aspect of Odisha’s approach is its network of Accredited Social Health Activists, or ASHAs, who serve as front-line workers to deliver essential malaria services across the state, particularly in rural and remote areas (For more on Odisha’s progress in fighting malaria, and the role played by ASHAs, see the photo essay on India takes on malaria in its highest burden state."
The report reveals that malaria is on the rise in the Americas. What are the factors that have contributed to this situation?,"Malaria cases in Venezuela have risen significantly over the past 3 years: 136 000 cases in 2015, 240 000 in 2016, and 411 000 in 2017. The increase is largely linked to the unaffordability of antimalarial drugs, weakened vector control programmes and the movement of malaria-infected persons in the gold-mining areas of Bolivar State into other areas of the country with malariaprone ecosystems.The rise in malaria cases in Nicaragua (2200 in 2015, 6200 in 2016 and 10 900 in 2017) is mainly due to increased malaria transmission in a municipality in the country’s Atlantic region. Here, migration combined with environmental and socio-economic factors have created prime conditions for malaria-carrying mosquitoes.After sustained progress in fighting malaria, Brazil has reported a significant jump in cases in the last two years, from 124 000 in 2016 to 189 000 in 2017. Increases were concentrated in several endemic states of the Amazon region, including in municipalities that had recently achieved significant reductions in transmission. A key challenge has been reaching remote and vulnerable populations with malaria prevention and control tools, such as diagnostic testing and treatment."
"The level of funding for the global malaria response stood at US$ 3.1 billion in 2017, a slight increase over 2016. What is needed to boost funding to reach the targets of the Global Technical Strategy?","Funding for malaria has levelled off in recent years. When analysed on a country-by-country per capita basis, investments have decreased for many high burden countries, averaging US$ 2.32 per person at risk annually. This level of funding translates into fewer resources available to protect increasing populations at risk of malaria. Despite the significant financial and economic crises experienced by many countries in the last few years, it is commendable that funding levels have remained stable. Still, to reach the targets of the GTS, it will be critical to increase international financing and the contributions of endemic countries."
This year’s report includes a section on malaria and anaemia. Why is this topic an important one to highlight in 2018?,"The special focus on anaemia is intended to raise awareness of malaria-related anaemia – a condition that, left untreated, can result in death, especially among vulnerable populations such as pregnant women and children under five.Anaemia was once a key indicator of progress in malaria control and its prevalence was used to evaluate the efficacy of interventions. Recent years have seen a decline in awareness of the burden of malaria-related anaemia, despite its importance as a direct and indirect consequence of malaria. As a result, the prevalence of anaemia among populations vulnerable to the disease has not been reported consistently as a metric of malaria transmission and burden.As highlighted in this year’s report, data from surveys conducted in 16 high burden African countries shows that, among children under 5 years of age, the prevalence of any anaemia was 61%, mild anaemia 25%, moderate anaemia 33% and severe anaemia 3%. Of children who tested positive for malaria, the prevalence of any anaemia was 79%, mild anaemia 21%, moderate anaemia 50% and severe anaemia 8%.By spotlighting malaria-related anaemia in this year’s report, we are signalling the importance of paying attention to anaemia and, at the same time, the need to better focus the malaria response on pregnant women and children under 5."
"Since the publication of last year’s report, WHO certified Paraguay as malaria-free. Are other countries close to certification, and are we still on track to reach the 2020 elimination milestone of the Global Technical Strategy for Malaria?","Globally, more countries are moving towards zero indigenous cases: in 2017, 46 countries reported fewer than 10 000 such cases, up from 37 countries in 2010.The number of countries with less than 100 indigenous cases – a strong indicator that elimination is within reach – increased from 15 in 2010 to 26 in 2017. China and El Salvador reported zero indigenous cases in 2017, a first for both countries. Algeria, Argentina and Uzbekistan have made formal requests to WHO for certification.One of the key GTS milestones for 2020 is elimination of malaria in at least 10 countries that were malaria endemic in 2015. At the current rate of progress, it is likely that this milestone will be reached."
"According to the report, coverage and use of insecticide treated bednets across sub-Saharan Africa are on the rise. Are these levels offering sufficient protection?","Looking at the WHO African Region, where malaria is heavily concentrated, we are seeing more people at risk of malaria being protected by insecticide treated bednets (ITNs). Information gathered from household surveys, ITN manufacturers and distributers, including through national malaria control programmes, point to a rise in both household ownership and use of ITNs.For example, over the 2010–2017 period, the percentage of the population protected by an ITN increased from 33% in 2010 to 56% in 2017; household ownership of at least one ITN rose from 47% to 72%; and households with at least one ITN for every two people doubled from 20% to 40%.However, coverage has only marginally improved since 2015, and we are far from reaching the target of universal coverage. Access of populations at risk of malaria to this core tool must be significantly expanded, particularly in high burden countries."
This year’s report features an expanded analysis of resistance to antimalarial drugs and insecticides. How big a threat is resistance to global efforts to control and eliminate malaria?,"WHO takes resistance to any effective disease-cutting tool very seriously. We are working with all malaria-endemic countries to monitor the efficacy of artemisinin-based antimalarial drugs and insecticides.Despite the presence of multidrug resistance in the Greater Mekong subregion, decreasing morbidity and mortality continue to be observed. Equally important to note is that the increase of malaria cases in the WHO African Region is not related to resistance to artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs), which remain fully effective as first-line treatments in these countries. Overall, the immediate threat of antimalarial drug resistance is low and most ACTs remain efficacious in all malaria-endemic settings outside the Greater Mekong.Insecticide resistance is more widespread. Of the 80 malaria endemic countries that provided data for 2010–2017, resistance to at least one of the 4 insecticide classes in one malaria vector from one collection site was detected in 68 countries, an increase over 2016 due to improved reporting and three new countries reporting on resistance for the first time. In 57 countries, resistance to two or more insecticide classes was reported.However, ITNs continue to be an effective tool for malaria prevention, even in areas where mosquitoes have developed resistance to pyrethroids (the only insecticide class used in ITNs). This was evidenced in a large multi-country evaluation coordinated by WHO between 2011 and 2016, which did not find an association between malaria disease burden and pyrethroid resistance across study locations in 5 countries."
"Coverage of seasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC) has slightly increased, but we continue to see significant coverage gaps. Why is this so?","Seasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC) is a WHO-recommended preventive treatment course for children living in the Sahel, a subregion of Africa. SMC is administered by community health workers at monthly intervals to all children aged 3 to 59 months throughout the high malaria transmission season.In 2017, an estimated 15.7 million children in 12 countries in the Sahel (Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Chad, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea Bissau, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal and Togo) were protected through SMC programmes. However, 13.6 million children who could have benefited from this intervention were not reached, with overall coverage at 53% across the subregion. Common issues reported by countries include insufficient resource allocation and delayed disbursements of funding, which negatively impact the ability of countries to plan and procure medicines in time for the malaria transmission season.WHO is calling on all countries in the subregion, and their development partners, to provide and sustain universal access to this important intervention for all children at risk of malaria."
1. What is Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)?,"Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is a viral respiratory illness caused by a coronavirus (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, or MERS‐CoV) that was first identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that can cause diseases in humans, ranging from the common cold to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)."
2. Where have cases of MERS been identified?,"Since 2012, MERS has been reported in 27 countries including Algeria, Austria, Bahrain, China, Egypt, France, Germany, Greece, Islamic Republic of Iran, Italy, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Malaysia, the Netherlands, Oman, Philippines, Qatar, Republic of Korea, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Thailand, Tunisia, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, United States, and Yemen. Approximately 80% of human cases reported by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Cases identified outside the Middle East are people who were infected in the Middle East and travelled to areas outside the Middle East. On rare occasions, small outbreaks have occurred in areas outside the Middle East.Maps and epidemic curves of laboratory confirmed cases of MERS reported to WHO since 2012Latest information on MERS outbreaks"
3. How do people get infected with the MERS virus?,"The MERS virus is transmitted primarily from animals to people, but transmission from people to people is also possible.From animals to peopleMERS-CoV is a zoonotic virus, meaning it is transmitted between animals and people. Scientific evidence suggests that people are infected through direct or indirect contact with infected dromedary camels. The MERS virus (written as MERS-CoV) has been identified in dromedary camels in several countries, including Egypt, Oman, Qatar and Saudi Arabia. There is further evidence suggesting the MERS-CoV is widespread in dromedary camels in the Middle East, Africa and parts of South Asia. It is possible that other animal reservoirs exist, however animals including goats, cows, sheep, water buffalo, swine, and wild birds have been tested for MERS-CoV and the virus has not been found.Between peopleMERS-CoV does not pass easily between people unless there is close contact, such as the provision of clinical care to an infected patient without strict hygiene measures. Transmission between people has been limited to-date, and has been identified among family members, patients, and health care workers. While, the majority of reported MERS cases to date have occurred in health care settings, thus far, no sustained human to human transmission has been documented anywhere in the world."
4. What are the symptoms of MERS? How severe is it?,"A typical case of MERS includes fever, cough, and/or shortness of breath. Pneumonia is common, however some people infected with the MERS virus have been reported to be asymptomatic. Gastrointestinal symptoms, including diarrhoea, have also been reported. Severe cases of MERS can include respiratory failure that requires mechanical ventilation and support in an intensive-care unit.Some patients have had organ failure, especially of the kidneys, or septic shock. The virus appears to cause more severe disease in people with weakened immune systems, older people, and people with chronic diseases as renal disease, diabetes, cancer, and chronic lung disease. The mortality rate for people with the MERS virus is approximately 35% – this may be an overestimate however, as mild cases may be missed by existing surveillance systems."
5. Is there a vaccine for MERS‐CoV? What is the treatment?,"No vaccine or specific treatment for MERS is currently available, however there are several vaccines for MERS in development. Treatment is supportive and based on a person’s clinical condition."
6. Can someone be infected with MERS-CoV and not be ill?,"Yes, infection with MERS-CoV can be asymptomatic. Infected people with no symptoms have been identified because they were tested for MERS-CoV during investigations among contacts of people known to be infected with MERS-CoV. The role of asymptomatic infected individuals in transmission is currently unknown and under investigation."
Why has WHO published these new Guidelines for malaria vector control?,"Over the decades, WHO has produced a large amount of valuable literature on malaria vector control, but it can be very difficult to navigate and to identify which information is the most up-to-date, or how different recommendations and guidance link together.These guidelines aim to overcome this challenge and simplify life for everyone involved in malaria vector control by creating a “one-stop shop” where all WHO key recommendations in this field are consolidated. And just as importantly, the guidelines are meant to greatly increase the transparency around the level of available evidence on which the WHO guidance is based.The ultimate goal of these guidelines is to ensure the best use of available resources for malaria vector control founded on a solid evidence base."
The new guidelines contain a mix of recommendations and good practice statements. Can you talk a bit more about this?,"Yes, we decided to bring recommendations and good practice statements all together in one document, as these complement each other.Recommendations are generally based on systematic reviews of evidence generated by randomized controlled trials and other rigorously designed and implemented studies. For example, a considerable number of trials have generated solid evidence that using insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) will reduce malaria in the geographic area where they are deployed. Based on this evidence, ITNs are recommended as a core intervention for malaria control. The recommendations tell people ""what to do"" – i.e. what intervention works.The best practice statements are more about ""how to""; they are largely based on expert opinion and field experience, as the evidence around them tends to not be generated by randomized trials. Using the example of ITNs, a best practice statement is that users should be educated not to wash their nets in fresh water bodies or use them for fishing as we know that pyrethroids used on the nets are very toxic to aquatic organisms."
What impact do you expect the guidelines to have for those implementing malaria vector control programmes?,"By making the recommendations more user-friendly, I think people will be more receptive to using them. I hope the guidelines make it much easier for national malaria control programmes and implementing partners not only to develop evidence-based vector control policies and strategies, but also to understand how specific tools should be deployed according to specific circumstances.By pulling together the ""what to do"" and the ""how to do it"" in one publication, countries will be better able to adapt their efforts to a particular malaria landscape. This will ultimately strengthen the link between the data that countries generate through their own research, including trials, their monitoring and surveillance activities (e.g. of insecticide resistance) and the use of this data in decision-making."
Do these guidelines contain new recommendations?,"The guidelines are largely a consolidation of existing recommendations as opposed to new ones. However, by bringing together more than 20 individual sets of WHO recommendations into one ""go-to"" document and combining them with best practice statements, it becomes a lot clearer what the key messages are in malaria vector control and how they all link together.As part of the guideline development process, the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group also conducted new systematic reviews or updated existing ones. This has provided the foundation for new – or at least clearer – recommendations. An example of this concerns the use of space spraying of insecticides, where it is made clear in the guidelines that this intervention should not be undertaken for malaria vector control."
The guidelines contain some strong recommendations based on low-certainty evidence. How is that possible?,"There are a number of reasons why there may be insufficient or poor data available on the effectiveness of certain interventions. The limited number of trials on IRS, and hence the weak evidence base for this intervention, provides a good example. Here we are dealing with an intervention that was first introduced over 50 years ago, at a time when the process to develop WHO recommendations and the associated evidence requirements had not been defined.Subsequently, a lot of operational experience has been gained that supports the use of this intervention, but randomized controlled trials aimed at generating gold standard evidence to establish the efficacy of this intervention are few and far between. In such cases, the development of WHO guidance relies to a considerable extent on lower quality evidence and expert opinion. In the formulation of recommendations, experts will also consider several factors other than data-based trials and studies, including:balance of benefit and harm;the values and preferences of individuals and populations affected by the recommendation (i.e. what importance people assign to the outcomes associated with the intervention);the acceptability of the intervention to the most important stakeholders, as well as feasibility and resource implications."
Are there implications for innovators and research partners?,"Absolutely. I believe the new document helps increase the level of transparency around the evidence that underpins WHO recommendations, and hence on the process that needs to be followed to generate an evidence base that allows WHO to develop or revise recommendations on vector control.Through greater transparency, we hope that innovators and research partners will understand why new tools and interventions need to be fully evaluated. After all, in the resource-constrained environment that most malaria-endemic countries operate in, the choice of a vector control intervention will come at the cost of something else, so prioritizing one over the other needs to be well justified. We really want all malaria stakeholders to recognize the benefits of conducting solid research which, in turn, generates an evidence base from which WHO can develop recommendations.In addition, the intensive process of putting together a comprehensive evidence base for these guidelines has helped to identify where there are evidence gaps, and this will help to inform the research agenda for the ongoing development of the guidelines."
How does WHO arrive at its estimates for cases in the World malaria report?,"WHO applies 3 methods for calculating estimates of malaria cases. One method uses routine data from countries without any adjustments; in other words, we use the data “as is”, directly from the country. This approach applies to countries that have a very low number of malaria cases, high-quality surveillance systems, and are near elimination.The second method is for countries outside of sub-Saharan Africa, excluding Botswana, Ethiopia, Namibia and Rwanda, that have a good public health surveillance system but where a large proportion of patients seek care in the private sector or do not seek treatment at all. Here, adjustments for testing rates, reporting and treatment seeking rates are applied to the reported data.The third method applies to most countries in the WHO African Region, where surveillance systems have been historically weak. To come up with a reliable estimate, we measure the relationship between parasite prevalence and case incidence within a specific area."
The 2018 report includes updated malaria case and death estimates for the period 2010 to 2016. Why have these estimates been revised?,"n many countries in the WHO African Region, which carries over 90% of the global malaria burden, improvements in surveillance systems are providing new insights. When better and more comprehensive data becomes available, previously-published WHO estimates are revised to reflect the new data from countries. What has not been updated or revised is the methodology used to arrive at the estimates included in the World malaria report.It is important to state that as national surveillance systems improve, the existing WHO model used to estimate malaria cases – i.e. parasite rate to case incidence – is likely underestimating the actual number of cases in many countries in the WHO African Region. In March 2018, WHO convened an Evidence Review Group that reviewed the Organization’s malaria burden estimation methods and made several recommendations for improvements. These recommendations will be implemented in the next edition of the World malaria report."
"The number of malaria cases is going up, yet the number of deaths is going down. Why?","Between 2010 and 2017, malaria deaths globally declined from 607 000 to 435 000. All regions except the Americas recorded reductions in mortality rates in 2017 when compared with 2010. The largest declines occurred in South-East Asia (-54%), Africa (-40%) and the Eastern Mediterranean (-10%). However, despite these gains, the reduction in mortality rates has slowed since 2015, reflecting the estimated trends in malaria case incidence.We exercise caution regarding malaria mortality estimates as weaknesses in most malaria endemic countries’ civil, vital statistics (registration of deaths) and routine health information systems do not allow for reliable analyses of causes of death. This is further compounded by different estimation methods used by WHO and other organizations, resulting in estimates with substantially different mean values for the same year and wide confidence intervals. For these and other reasons, WHO has established an Evidence Review Group on malaria mortality to review existing data and methods to provide the Organization with advice on the best mortality estimation approaches to use in the future."
7. Is it easy to detect people who are infected with MERS-CoV?,"It is not always possible to identify people infected with the MERS virus because early symptoms of the disease are non-specific and are often mistaken for other respiratory diseases. For this reason, all health care facilities should have standard infection prevention and control practices in place. It is also important to investigate the travel history of people with respiratory infection to determine if they have recently visited countries with active MERS-CoV circulation or have had contact with dromedary camels."
8. Is MERS contagious?,"Yes, but human to human transmission has been limited. The virus does not seem to pass easily from person to person unless there is close contact, such as occurs when providing unprotected care for a patient. There have been clusters of cases in health care facilities, where human-to-human transmission appears to be more efficient, especially when infection prevention and control practices are inadequate. The largest health care associated outbreaks have occurred in Saudi Arabia and the Republic of Korea."
9. What is contact tracing and why is it important?,"Those in close contact with someone who has MERS are at higher risk of infection, and of potentially infecting others if they begin to show symptoms. Closely watching such persons for 14 days from the last day of exposure to a confirmed case will help that person to get care and treatment and will prevent further transmission of the virus to others. This monitoring process is called contact tracing, which can be broken down into three basic steps:Contact identification: Once a case is confirmed, contacts are identified by asking about the activities of the case and the activities and roles of the people around the case since onset of illness. Contacts can be family members or anyone who has been in contact with the case, for example, people encountered at work, social events or in health care facilities.Contact listing: All persons considered to have contact with the confirmed case should be listed as contacts. Efforts should be made to identify every listed contact and inform them of their contact status, what it means, the actions that will follow, and the importance of receiving early care if they develop symptoms. The contact should also be provided with information about prevention of the disease. In some cases, quarantine or isolation is required for high risk contacts, either at home, or in hospital.Contact follow-up: Follow-up all listed contacts daily for 14 days from the last time they were in contact with the confirmed MERS patient for the development of signs and symptoms and for testing for MERS-CoV."
10. What should a person do if she/he has contact with a person who has MERS?,"If you have had close contact with someone infected with MERS-CoV within the last 14 days without using the recommended infection control precautions, you should contact a healthcare provider for an evaluation."
11. What is the source of the MERS virus?,"MERS-CoV has been found in dromedary camels in several countries, including in Burkina Faso, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, Jordan, Kenya, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Mali, Morocco, Netherlands, Nigeria, Oman, Pakistan, Qatar, Spain (Canary Islands), Somalia, Sudan, Tunisia, and the United Arab Emirates. It is possible that other animal reservoirs exist. However, animals including goats, cows, sheep, water buffalo, swine, and wild birds have been tested for MERS-CoV and the virus has not been found. These studies support the premise that dromedary camels are the likely source of infection in humans, but studies and investigations have not yet identified how humans are infected with the MERS virus.The origins of the virus are not fully understood but, according to the analysis of different virus genomes, it is believed that MERS-CoV may have originated in bats and was transmitted to camels in the distance past."
"12. Should people avoid contact with camels or camel products? Is it safe to visit farms, markets, or camel fairs?","As a general precaution, anyone visiting farms, markets, barns, or other places where animals are present should practice general hygiene measures. These include regular hand-washing before and after touching animals, and avoiding contact with sick animals.The consumption of raw or undercooked animal products, including milk and meat, carries a high risk of infection from a variety of organisms. Animal products processed appropriately through cooking or pasteurization are safe for consumption, but should also be handled with care to avoid cross-contamination with uncooked foods. Camel meat and camel milk are nutritious products that can be consumed after pasteurization, cooking, or other heat treatments.Until more is understood about MERS-CoV, people with diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised persons are considered to be at high risk of severe disease from MERS-CoV infection. Especially in the Middle East, this group of people should avoid contact with dromedary camels, consuming raw camel milk or camel urine, as well as eating meat that has not been properly cooked.Camel farm and slaughterhouse workers should practice good personal hygiene, including frequent hand washing, facial protection, and protective clothing (which should be removed after work and washed daily). Workers should also avoid exposing family members to soiled work clothing, shoes, or other items that may have come into contact with camels or camel excretions. Sick animals should never be slaughtered for consumption. People should avoid direct contact with any animal that has been confirmed positive for MERS-CoV infection."
13. Are health care workers at risk from MERS‐CoV?,"Yes. Transmission of MERS-CoV has occurred in health care facilities in several countries, most notably in Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and the Republic of Korea. It is not always possible to identify patients infected with MERS-CoV early or without testing because symptoms may be mild and other clinical features may be non-specific. For this reason, it is important that health care workers apply standard precautions consistently while caring for all patients.Droplet precautions should be added to standard precautions when providing care to all patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection. Contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for suspected or confirmed cases of MERS. Airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol‐generating procedures.Infection prevention and control during health care for MERS"
14. How is WHO responding to MERS?,"WHO is working with academic and public health professionals to gather and share scientific evidence to better understand the virus and the disease it causes, and to determine outbreak response priorities, treatment strategies, and clinical management approaches. WHO is also working with affected countries and international partners, such as FAO and OIE, to coordinate the global health response, including providing updated information, conducting risk assessments and coordinated investigations with national authorities, convening scientific meetings, and developing technical guidance and training on surveillance, laboratory testing, infection prevention and control, and clinical management.WHO is also coordinating with the affected and at risk countries, international health partners, FAO and OIE to address current knowledge gaps on MERS as well as developing medical countermeasures in both dromedary and human populations. MERS-CoV is one of the high threat pathogens included in the WHO’s Research & Development Blue Print which provides a road map for research and development of diagnostic, preventive and therapeutic products for prevention, early detection and response.The Director‐General convened an Emergency Committee under the International Health Regulations (2005) to advise as to whether this event constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) and on public health measures that should be taken. Information on the deliberations of the Committee can be found here:IHR Emergency Committee concerning MERS-CoV"
15. What does WHO recommend?,"For countriesWHO encourages all Member States to enhance their surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns of SARI or cases of pneumonia. Cases should be isolated as soon as possible, and close contacts should be identified and monitored. WHO urges Member States to notify or verify to WHO any probable or confirmed case of MERS. WHO also urges Member States to stay abreast of the evolution of the disease and modify their interventions according to current risk. WHO guidance is available at the following links.Surveillance guidanceLaboratory guidanceCase management and infection prevention controlFor health care workersInfection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. Health care facilities that provide care for suspected or confirmed MERS patients should take appropriate measure to decrease the risk of transmission of the virus from an infected patient to other patients, health care workers, and visitors. Health care workers should be educated, trained, and refreshed with skills on standard infection prevention and control.Infection prevention and control during health care for MERS"
16. General travel advice,"Given the current pattern of transmission of the disease WHO does not recommend travel or trade restrictions with regard to MERS-CoV. However, national authorities may take precautions aimed at raising awareness of MERS and its symptoms among travellers to and from affected areas, based on their own local risk assessment.As required by the International Health Regulations (IHR 2005), countries should ensure that routine measures are in place for assessing ill travellers detected on board means of transport (such as planes and ships) and at points of entry, as well as measures for safe transportation of symptomatic travellers to hospitals or designated facilities for clinical assessment and treatment. If a sick traveller is on board a plane, a passenger locator form can be used. This form is useful for collecting contact information for passengers, which can be used for follow-up if necessary.International travel and health"
What is insecticide resistance?,"Insecticide resistance refers to changes in an insect that increase its ability to withstand or overcome the effects of one or more insecticides. When the frequency of resistant insects in a population increases (e.g. through resistance traits being passed on from one generation to another), the efficacy of an insecticidal intervention can be compromised. Increased frequency of resistant insects may be detected through assays that measure insect mortality in response to a particular insecticide, or through genetic tests that detect resistance mechanisms in individual insects.In malaria control, the insecticides currently recommended for use against the potential parasite-carrying adult Anopheles mosquitoes belong to five classes: carbamates, organochlorines, organophosphates, pyrethroids and neonicotinoids. These insecticides are commonly deployed through the core malaria interventions of insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS).The potential result of mosquito resistance to insecticides is that the insects are not killed when they come into contact with a standard dose of an insecticide deployed through ITNs or IRS. However, this does not mean that these interventions will be ineffective immediately, or that there will be a surge in malaria cases. For example, when mosquitoes are resistant to pyrethroids, ITNs still provide protection for the people using them."
When was insecticide resistance first identified?,"Insecticide resistance is not a new phenomenon; it has been an undesired side-effect of malaria vector control since insecticides first came into broad use in the 1940s. Malaria-endemic countries should be aware of the importance of detecting and preventing the development and spread of insecticide resistance. Increasingly, countries are including insecticide-resistance monitoring and management practices in their national malaria control strategies.However, in most endemic countries – particularly in sub-Saharan Africa – control strategies focus on scaling up vector-control interventions. Only limited resources are made available to build capacity for entomological monitoring and insecticide susceptibility testing, and to design and implement strategies to manage insecticide resistance.The main factor driving the emergence and spread of resistance during the past decade has been the heavy reliance on a single class of insecticides – pyrethroids – for both public health and agriculture purposes. Pyrethroids are highly effective and safe. They are the least expensive of the 5 classes of insecticides used in malaria vector control, and are the only class available for use on ITNs. In some areas, the use of pyrethroids and similar insecticides in agriculture appears to have contributed to the development of resistance in mosquitoes.Currently, ITNs appear to remain effective in countries with malaria transmission although there is evidence emerging from some areas that resistance can reduce the impact of pyrethroid IRS. To sustain the remarkable gains in malaria control and move towards malaria elimination, urgent action is required to prevent the further development of resistance and maintain the effectiveness of vector-control interventions."
How many countries currently have evidence of insecticide resistance?,"Since 2010, a total of 68 countries have reported resistance to at least one class of insecticide, with 57 of those countries reporting resistance to two or more classes. Widespread resistance to pyrethroids has been reported for malaria vectors from numerous countries in sub-Saharan Africa as well as central and south-east Asia.Recent data are considered the most relevant because insecticide resistance can vary over time in response to a range of factors, and can also differ greatly over short distances. However, not all countries with ongoing malaria transmission undertake routine resistance monitoring, and when monitoring is done, it often fails to include all insecticide classes, main malaria vectors or eco-epidemiological zones. In addition, there are critical issues with the national management and timely sharing of resistance data. Our understanding of the scale of insecticide resistance is therefore incomplete. As routine monitoring is scaled up, a more detailed picture will emerge about the state of insecticide resistance.A global database on insecticide resistance was established in 2014 to provide timely tracking of changing insecticide-resistance patterns and to identify where data are lacking. The data have also been made available through the online Malaria Threats Map. Such databases can assist endemic countries and their partners to take targeted action. WHO provides updates on the number of countries monitoring and detecting insecticide resistance in the annual World malaria report.Guidelines for malaria vector controlGlobal report on insecticide resistance in malaria vectors: 2010–2016"
What is the GPIRM and how has it been developed?,"he WHO Global plan for insecticide resistance management in malaria vectors (GPIRM) was released in May 2012 as a call to action to tackle the threat of insecticide resistance. It was developed in response to a request in 2011 by the World Health Assembly and the Board of the Roll Back Malaria Partnership which reflected the collective belief that a global strategy was needed to serve as the foundation of a coordinated multi-stakeholder response.The GPIRM was developed through a broad-based consultation with over 130 stakeholders. These stakeholders represented all constituencies of the malaria community, including malaria-endemic countries, multilateral agencies, development partners, academia and industry. The plan included the latest available evidence on the extent of insecticide resistance around the world, and put forward a strategy for global and country levels, identifying clear roles and timelines for all stakeholders.Through the GPIRM, WHO and the Roll Back Malaria Partnership urge governments of malaria-endemic countries and their partners to implement a five-pillar strategy to tackle the growing threat of insecticide resistance, including to facilitate the development of innovative tools and strategies for vector control.Global plan for insecticide resistance management in malaria vectors"
What are the solutions put forward by the GPIRM?,"The GPIRM is based on 5 pillars that address actions spanning the short, medium and long term. It requires coordinated action from all stakeholders, including national malaria control programmes and national regulatory authorities, WHO, donors and other multilateral organizations, research institutions and partners in the public health insecticide industry. The strategy calls on stakeholders to:plan and implement insecticide-resistance management (IRM) strategies in malaria-endemic countries;ensure capacity for proper, timely entomological monitoring and effective data management;develop new, innovative vector-control tools;fill knowledge gaps on the mechanisms of insecticide resistance and the impact of current approaches to IRM; andensure that key enabling mechanisms – including advocacy, and human and financial resources – are in place.Malaria-endemic countries are encouraged to modify their vector-control programmes to address insecticide resistance. The starting point is to analyse the state of insecticide resistance and to design a comprehensive IRM strategy. To support this, WHO produced a Framework for national plan for monitoring and management of insecticide resistance in malaria vectors. Countries should strive to have pre-emptive IRM strategies in place and integrate related costs into national budgets for malaria control.Framework for a national plan for monitoring and management of insecticide resistance in malaria vectorsIn parallel, all endemic countries should build capacity to collect, handle and interpret data on resistance, and leverage that information for making decisions about vector control. Through IRM, endemic countries can delay the evolution of resistance, preserve the effectiveness of existing insecticides, and even reverse resistance in some settings. Successful implementation of the GPIRM will require coordinated action between all partners in the malaria control community as well as other sectors, such as agriculture and finance."
How will you ensure the guidelines stay up-to-date with developments in the malaria vector control landscape?,"We see the Guidelines for malaria vector control as a ""living document"". They are very much a work in progress and will continually take into account new tools, new evidence, and new guidance. We plan to update the guidelines on an ongoing basis; the document will only be made available in a web-based format so that it can be revised as soon as new evidence is assessed by WHO.In parallel, we aim to continue improving and clarifying how new tools are evaluated, and we will continue to look for opportunities to make the evaluation process more nimble. We are also seeking input from people using the guidelines. We really want to emphasize that in order for these guidelines to be as good as possible, we do need to have people’s feedback and willingness to contribute towards them.For this purpose, we have set up a dedicated email address to which feedback can be directed:vcguidelines@who.int. We will also be proactively collecting user feedback through other means, including regular user surveys."
What are autism spectrum disorders?,Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are a group of complex brain development disorders. This umbrella term covers conditions such as autism and Asperger syndrome. These disorders are characterized by difficulties in social interaction and communication and a restricted and repetitive repertoire of interests and activities.
How common are autism spectrum disorders?,"Reviews estimate that 1 child in 160 has an autism spectrum disorder. This estimate represents an average figure, and reported prevalence varies substantially across studies. Some recent studies have, however, reported rates that are substantially higher."
Do people with an autism spectrum disorder always suffer from intellectual disability?,"The level of intellectual functioning is extremely variable in persons with an autism spectrum disorder, ranging from profound impairment to superior non-verbal cognitive skills. It is estimated that around 50% of persons with ASD also suffer from an intellectual disability."
How early can an autism spectrum disorder be recognized in children?,Identifying an autism spectrum disorder is difficult before the age of about 12 months but diagnosis is generally possible by the age of 2 years. Characteristic features of the onset include delay in the development or temporary regression in language and social skills and repetitive stereotyped patterns of behaviour.
What can parents do to help their child with an autism spectrum disorder?,"Parents have an essential role in providing support to a child with an autism spectrum disorder. They can help to ensure access to health services and education, and offer nurturing and stimulating environments as their child grows up. Recently, it has been shown that parents can also help deliver psychosocial and behavioural treatments to their own children."
What causes autism spectrum disorders?,"Scientific evidence suggests that various factors, both genetic and environmental, contribute to the onset of autism spectrum disorders by influencing early brain development."
Are childhood vaccines responsible for autism spectrum disorders?,"Available epidemiological data show that there is no evidence of a link between measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine and autism spectrum disorders. Previous studies suggesting a causal link were found to be seriously flawed. There is also no evidence to suggest that any other childhood vaccine may increase the risk of autism spectrum disorders.  In addition, evidence reviews commissioned by WHO concluded that there was no association between the use of vaccine preservatives such as thiomersal and autism spectrum disorders."
17. Travel to the Middle East,"WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry, nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions. Recommended actions include:1. Advise travelers with pre-existing medical conditions to avoid contact with dromedary camels in the Middle East, and in other countries where infected dromedaries have been identified.Show more..."
What are the implications of insecticide resistance for LLIN and IRS effectiveness?,"All types of ITNs currently recommended by WHO are treated with pyrethroids. During the past decade, vector control has relied heavily on pyrethroids, and countries have now reported widespread resistance to insecticides of this class. Nevertheless, there are few proven cases in which insecticide resistance has been linked to decreased effectiveness of ITNs or increases in malaria cases.In 2016, WHO reported on the findings of a large, multi-country evaluation to assess the impact of insecticide resistance on malaria vector control interventions – primarily long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs). The 5-year evaluation found that people who slept under LLINs in the evaluation areas had significantly lower rates of malaria infection than those who did not use a net, even though mosquitoes showed resistance to pyrethroids in all of these areas.This study reaffirms the WHO recommendation of universal LLIN coverage for all populations at risk of malaria. Even in areas where resistance has been identified, countries should continue to scale up or maintain universal coverage with LLINs as:LLINs act as a physical barrier against parasite-carrying mosquitoes; andeven a sublethal effect of the insecticide on mosquitoes is likely to contribute to malaria control.IRS using non-pyrethroid insecticides may also be implemented in areas with LLINs, for resistance management purposes. Larval source management may provide an opportunity for IRM, because there is greater diversity in larvicides including biological formulations, and habitat modification or manipulation can reduce overall dependence on insecticides.However, interventions targeting the larval and pupal stages of mosquitoes are appropriate only in certain settings, where mosquito aquatic habitats are few, fixed and findable. With continued reliance on LLINs and IRS, the operational impact of their use must be monitored closely, and resistance should be tested at sentinel sites at least once a year and more often if feasible."
What progress has been made in implementing the GPIRM since its release in 2012?,"According to the World malaria report 2018, 40 countries have completed their insecticide resistance monitoring and management plans, in line with the GPIRM. WHO continues to work with governments of endemic countries, donor organizations, United Nations agencies, and research and industry partners to implement the 5-pillar strategy contained in the GPIRM; this includes ongoing support for the development of new and innovative vector-control tools and strategies.Urgent efforts are required to ensure the correct use of existing interventions and the availability of new tools to maintain the effectiveness of malaria vector control."

What is meant by a fair price?,"For the purposes of this initiative a ‘fair’ price is one that is affordable for health systems and patients and that at the same time provides sufficient market incentive for industry to invest in innovation and the production of medicines. In other words, fairness here implies positive incentives and/or benefits for all stakeholders – i.e. those who purchase and use medicines, and those involved in the R&D and manufacture of medicines."
Does the concept of ‘fair pricing’ replace the principle of affordability?,"Absolutely not. The Fair Pricing Forum strives to increase access through better affordability. It focuses on new, high-priced medicines and vaccines that are currently unaffordable in most countries – regardless of income. But it also looks at old medicines whose prices have been so reduced that they no longer present any kind of incentive for manufacturers. The principle of affordability and access to quality medicines guides the fair pricing initiative and remains a stalwart of WHO’s work on access to medical products."
Pricing Forum taking place?,"The Forum is taking place in Johannesburg, South Africa, on 11-13 April 2019 and is co-sponsored by the South African National Department of Health and WHO."
Is it a WHO or a South African initiative?,"Fair pricing is a WHO initiative supported by many governments, including the Government of South Africa through its Minister of Health, who will be hosting the forum along with the WHO Director-General."
What does it aim to achieve?,"The ‘Fair Pricing Forum’ aims to provide a global platform to discuss ways to improve access to medicines – including high-priced ones – within the overall effort of supporting countries to develop effective access strategies to achieve universal health coverage. At the same time, it also intends to understand the input needed by the pharmaceutical industry to improve R&D and innovation from a public health perspective and to keep old and generic essential medicines on the market."
Who will be invited to participate in the forum?,"Participants include WHO Member State Governments, patient associations, civil society, insurers and the pharmaceutical industry."
What is at the origin of the fair pricing forum – why now?,"The intention behind the fair pricing initiative is closely linked to WHO’s broader agenda for supporting access to medicines, improving public health across all regions and promoting universal health coverage. In addition, WHO Member States have formally requested that WHO’s Director General, through World Health Assembly Resolution WHA67.22 (Access to essential medicines, 2014), support countries to “ensure access to safe, effective and quality-assured essential medicines, including high price essential medicines.”The current status of medicines prices is fast becoming one of the biggest challenges to health systems everywhere and is the subject of countless debates in parliaments and in both medical and mainstream media. The time is ripe for greater involvement of the global health community to discuss this issue and seek realistic solutions for greater affordability. The main barrier to accessing many new and effective medicines, especially for cancer and orphan drugs, and more recently for hepatitis C, is their lack of affordability, even when there is evidence to show that manufacturing them is relatively inexpensive. This problem is now touching not only low-income countries, it is affecting middle- and high-income countries as well.At the other end of the spectrum is the problem of drug shortages or poor quality for some old and off-patent medicines. There are a number of examples, ranging from benzathine penicillin to methotrexate, where there are significant problems with lack of manufacturers. For these products, it is necessary to work out what a ‘fair’ price would be that ensures quality products and ongoing supply."
What is WHO’s role in this field?,"WHO has both the mandate and the responsibility to address barriers to accessing health products and services that are vital to improving public health. As the global health coordinator within the UN system, WHO provides a unique global platform to discuss policy options for increased access to medicines through its convening power with all public health actors, both national and international."
What is artemisinin and how is it used for the treatment of malaria?,"Isolated from the plant Artemisia annua, or sweet wormwood, artemisinin and its derivatives are powerful medicines known for their ability to swiftly reduce the number of Plasmodium parasites in the blood of patients with malaria.

Artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) are recommended by WHO as the first-and second-line treatment for uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria as well as for chloroquine-resistant P. vivax malaria. ACTs combine an artemisinin derivative1 with a partner drug. The role of the artemisinin compound is to reduce the number of parasites during the first 3 days of treatment (reduction of parasite biomass), while the role of the partner drug is to eliminate the remaining parasites (cure).

WHO currently recommends 5 different ACTs.2 In areas where other ACTs are failing, the use of artesunate-pyronaridine, a new ACT which has received a positive scientific opinion from the European Medicines Agency, may be considered.3 Two injectable treatments, artesunate or artemether, are recommended for the treatment of severe malaria and should be followed by an ACT when the patient can tolerate oral therapy.

Increased access to ACTs in malaria-endemic countries has been integral to the remarkable success in reducing the global malaria burden over the last 15 years. An estimated 2.74 billion treatment courses of ACT were procured by countries over the period 2010–2017. An estimated 62% of these procurements were reported to have been made for the public sector."
What is the definition of “artemisinin resistance”?,"Artemisinin resistance typically refers to a delay in the clearance of malaria parasites from the bloodstream following treatment with an ACT. As a result, the artemisinin compound is less effective in clearing all parasites within a 3-day period among patients who are infected with artemisinin-resistant strains of malaria.

Recent studies have demonstrated that the mechanisms of resistance developed by the parasites against artemisinin compounds affect only one stage of the malaria parasite cycle in humans: the ring stage. It is, thus, more appropriate to call the delayed clearance “partial resistance”, to highlight this time-limited and cycle-specific feature. It is unknown whether partial artemisinin resistance could further evolve to affect other stages of the parasites, developing into complete resistance.

Currently, even if patients are infected with artemisinin-resistant parasites, nearly all patients treated with an ACT are fully cured provided that the partner drug is highly efficacious in that geographical area. In the absence of partner drug resistance, artemisinin partial resistance rarely leads to treatment failure. Furthermore, there is no evidence that artemisinin partial resistance alone has resulted in an increase in malaria morbidity and mortality in the GMS. Nevertheless, the proportion of treatment failures increase when both resistance to artemisinin and to ACT partner drugs are present, compared to resistance to the partner drug alone."
What is the state of partial artemisinin resistance around the world?,"Artemisinin partial resistance likely emerged prior to 2001, and prior to the widespread deployment of ACTs in the GMS. To date, it has been confirmed in 5 countries of the GMS: Cambodia, the Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Myanmar, Thailand and Viet Nam.

In late 2013, researchers identified a new molecular marker: mutations in the Kelch 13 (K13) propeller domain were shown to be associated with delayed parasite clearance in vitro and in vivo. The molecular marker allows for a more precise mapping and monitoring of the geographical distribution of resistance. It could also be a mechanism for retrospective mapping of resistance in a large number of settings.

Parasites carrying mutations in the K13 propeller domain have been reported in all 5 GMS countries listed above as well as in Guyana, where studies are ongoing to evaluate impact of this mutation on delayed clearance and ACT efficacy and its potential spread within and outside South America.

Molecular studies have shown that partial artemisinin resistance has emerged independently in several locations in the GMS and spread within the subregion. The K13 mutation identified in South America has also emerged independently. Artemisinin partial resistance has not been confirmed in Africa.

Partial artemisinin resistance has occurred as a consequence of several factors: poor treatment practices, inadequate patient adherence to prescribed antimalarial regimens, and the widespread availability of oral artemisinin-based monotherapies and substandard forms of the drug."
What is the current state of ACT failures around the world?,"Artemisinin resistance alone rarely leads to treatment failure. However, resistance of malaria parasites to ACT partner drugs can lead to treatment failure (regardless of the presence of artemisinin partial resistance). As a consequence, several ACTs are failing in the Greater Mekong an area where both artemisinin and ACT partner drug resistance have been identified.

The geographic scope of the problem could widen quickly and have important public health consequences: the spread or independent emergence of partner drug resistance or multidrug resistance globally could pose a public health threat, as no alternative antimalarial medicine is available at present with the same level of efficacy and tolerability as ACTs.

The efficacy of WHO-recommended ACTs is assessed through therapeutic efficacy studies (TES). Such studies at regular intervals at the same sites allow for the early detection of declines in drug efficacy, providing evidence for guiding national malaria treatment policies."
How is WHO supporting countries in their efforts to tackle multidrug resistance including partial artemisinin resistance and ACT partner drug resistance?,"WHO is working with national malaria programmes, research institutions, and other partners – within and outside of the GMS – to map the presence of artemisinin partial resistance and partner drug resistance; the latter is equally important in view of the consequences seen in terms of ACT treatment failures.TES remain the primary tool for monitoring the efficacy of nationally recommended antimalarial treatments in all countries. Molecular markers are an asset for early warning signals, or to investigate whether ACT treatment failures were to the result of resistance. To improve the response to multidrug resistance in the GMS, countries, with the support of WHO and partners, continually collect and analyse quality data at sentinel sites across the subregion.Reducing the prevalence of malaria in the GMS – with the ultimate goal of elimination – will mitigate the risk of the spread of multidrug resistant parasites outside the GMS. In collaboration with national malaria programmes and partners, WHO led the development of the Strategy for malaria elimination in the Greater Mekong Subregion (2015–2030). Urging immediate action, the strategy calls for the elimination of all species of human malaria across the GMS by 2030, with priority action targeted to areas where multidrug-resistant malaria parasites have been identified.Strategy for malaria elimination in the Greater Mekong Subregion (2015–2030)With technical guidance from WHO, all GMS countries have developed national malaria elimination plans. As countries implement these plans, WHO is providing ongoing technical support through its 5 GMS country offices, regional offices in New Delhi and Manila, and the Organization’s Geneva headquarters.In 2017, WHO launched the Mekong Malaria Elimination (MME) programme. The MME subregional team in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, supports the GMS malaria elimination strategy by facilitating coordination and dialogue among partners, communicating with external stakeholders, and coordinating cross-border initiatives.Urgent action now will deliver significant savings in the long run, improving the sustainability and public health impact of malaria interventions around the world."
Argentina has been officially certified by WHO as malaria-free. How did the country achieve this milestone? What were the key elements to success?,"After the Global Malaria Eradication Programme ended in the 1960s, Argentina continued on its own course to eliminate malaria from within its borders. It did this through a targeted effort based in the north of Argentina, where the malaria burden was highest (provinces of Salta, Jujuy and Misiones). Malaria efforts focused mainly on controlling mosquito breeding sites, spraying houses with insecticides, conducting active surveillance, diagnosing malaria through microscopy, and conducting case investigations to understand where infections were occurring.Additionally, beginning in the late 1990s, Argentina and Bolivia entered into several agreements to work together on cross-border health issues, including malaria. Between 2000 and 2011, Argentina worked closely with the Bolivian Government to spray more than 22 000 homes with insecticides and take more than 25 000 blood samples in border areas to test for the presence of malaria parasites. During this period, the number of cases of malaria in Argentina fell from 440 to 0."
"What systems did the country put in place to make this achievement possible? Now that Argentina is officially malaria-free, will these systems remain operational?","The Government of Argentina recognized that although a vertical approach was critical to the successful elimination of malaria, maintaining zero cases would require a system that was sustainable. In recent years, the country has completely integrated its malaria programme into the national health care system; the most important change was the integration of malaria surveillance into the national surveillance system for febrile illness. All cases of fever are now entered into this national system, which allows for suspected malaria cases to be rapidly identified and tested.Additionally, in 2 of Argentina’s northern provinces, where the risk of re-establishment of malaria is greatest, malaria prevention and treatment services have been integrated into an excellent primary health care system that engages a large cadre of paid community health workers. Through regular household visits, health workers help the population understand when they need to seek medical attention. They follow up on suspected malaria cases to ensure they are tested and treated. In some remote areas, community health workers are equipped with radios so that they can contact provincial health authorities for assistance to transport seriously ill patients to the nearest hospital.Finally, Argentina has an excellent capacity to respond to disease outbreaks. For many years, health providers have been using this system to respond to outbreaks of cholera and dengue. By integrating malaria into this system, they will be able to quickly interrupt transmission should any outbreak of malaria occur."
How does Argentina stand to benefit from its new malaria-free status?,"Argentina now joins the ranks of 37 other countries and overseas territories that have been certified malaria-free by WHO. The population of Argentina is now liberated from of an infection that caused illness, frequent relapses, serious disease and death. The national healthcare system will be able to focus its effort and attention on other diseases that currently pose threats to the population’s health, while maintaining vigilance to prevent the reintroduction of malaria. The country will also be able to promote itself to international businesses and tourists as malaria-free and gain economic benefits from removing an impediment to further business and social development."
Are there lessons learned from Argentina’s malaria-elimination effort that can be applied to other countries?,"The extent of the cross-border collaboration and coordination between Argentina and Bolivia is almost unprecedented. Argentina benefited from the joint activities that were critical to shortening the timeline towards malaria elimination. Bolivia also benefited from this collaboration, reducing malaria along the border and many kilometers into the interior of the country."
"According to WHO’s World malaria report 2018, there was a sharp spike in malaria cases in Venezuela between 2015 and 2017. What is the potential for malaria to spread from Venezuela to Argentina?","Approximately half of the territory of Venezuela was certified malaria-free in 1960, before WHO began certifying only entire countries or overseas territories. The significant increase in cases since 2015 is the result of several factors, including an expansion of gold mining and a declining economic situation. As the economy worsens, there has been increased migration from Venezuela to other countries in the region, including Argentina.Malaria-free countries such as Argentina and Paraguay facing the challenge of imported cases of malaria should intensify actions to prevent a reintroduction of the disease; to this end, they should ensure access to health services for migrants and conduct active malaria surveillance among populations at risk of the disease.Argentina and Paraguay have both shown that they are fully capable of rapidly detecting imported cases of malaria and responding in a timely manner. Overall, the risk of a resurgence of malaria in both countries – although real – is low."
What evidence/data will WHO use to argue for fairness in pricing?,"In the lead-up to the forum, WHO will publish reports and landscape analyses related to pricing and the cost of R&D and production of medicines and other health technologies. It is hoped that a comprehensive report on pricing will be ready for launch at the May forum."
"How does this fair pricing initiative fit in with the GSPOA, CEWG and the UNHLP on access to medicines?","Fair pricing focuses on specific issues related to pricing (high and low prices) that constitute access barriers in an attempt to find strategies for countries to address these barriers in the near future. We believe that this initiative will contribute to the goals of the Global Strategy and Plan of action on Public Health, Innovation and Intellectual Property (GSPOA), the Consultative Expert Working Group on Research and Development (CEWG) and the UN High Level Panel on Access to Medicines. The initiative does not replace WHO’s ongoing work on intellectual property and TRIPS flexibilities."
Who is funding these efforts?,"The fight to eliminate malaria in the GMS is supported through generous contributions from a number of donors, including: the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (Global Fund), the UK Department for International Development and the US Agency for International Development. In response to the emergence of partial artemisinin resistance in the GMS, the Global Fund launched the Regional Artemisinin-resistance Initiative (RAI) in 2013. Funding provided through this initiative has enabled countries to purchase and distribute commodities such as long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs), rapid diagnostic tests and quality-assured drugs. In 2017, the Global Fund announced an expansion of the RAI (RAI2E), committing an additional US$ 242 million for the period 2018 to 2020. WHO is working with GMS countries and the Global Fund to optimize the use of this funding in the subregion."
What more needs to be done to address this threat?,"Scaling up prevention and control interventions and implementing all of WHO’s recommendations require considerable financial resources, long-term political commitment, and strong cross-border cooperation. Endemic countries outside the GMS – and, in particular, in the WHO African Region, where malaria took an estimated 404 500 lives in 2017 – need to also identify additional resources to prevent the emergence and spread of partial artemisinin and partner drug resistance. One of the most urgent challenges is to strengthen pharmaceutical market regulation, and remove oral artemisinin-based monotherapies and substandard medicines from markets around the world once and for all."
What is cOAlition S?,"cOAlition S is an initiative of the European Commission and the European Research Council to make full and immediate open access to research publications a reality. Its members include research councils and funding bodies from across Europe and several non-State actors representing philanthropic foundations, including the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the Wellcome Trust. It has also attracted support from outside Europe, most notably from national research bodies in China and India. [Funders that have endorsed Plan S and are jointly working on its implementation.

Membership requires a public statement in support of the 10 principles of Plan S and how they will be implemented. It should be noted that much of its structure and governance has yet to be defined. Governance and organisational structure. [Brussels: Science Europe; 2019 (https://www.coalition-s.org/governance/, accessed 28 August 2019).]"
What is Plan S?,"Plan S is an initiative that seeks to ensure that “all scholarly publications on the results from research funded by public or private grants provided by national, regional and international research councils and funding bodies,” are published in open-access journals, on open-access platforms, or made immediately available through open-access repositories without embargo. This means that the public can freely access and reuse the research immediately without cost barriers and under the terms of an open licence. Plan S includes a set of 10 principles and guidance on how those principles can be implemented. [Principles and implementation. Brussels: Science Europe; 2019 (https://www.coalition-s.org/principles-and-implementation/, accessed 28 August 2019).]Plan S: making full and immediate open access a reality. [Brussels: Science Europe; 2019 (https://www.coalition-s.org, accessed 28 August 2019).]"
When will Plan S come into effect?,"Plan S will come into effect from 1 January 2021. This will follow an extensive period of consultation with the public and major stakeholders in order to establish the framework for the implementation of the Plan. WHO will engage with other members of cOAlition S during its implementation and will provide updates on how the WHO open-access policy will evolve.[WHO policy on open access. Geneva: World Health Organization; 2017 (https://www.who.int/publishing/openaccess/en/, accessed 28 August 2019).]"
Why has WHO joined cOAlition S?,"The principles of Plan S are strongly aligned with the objectives of WHO’s institutional policies (such as the WHO open-access policy) and its strategies (such as the WHO strategy on research for health), as well as its strategic objectives,
        including achieving the Sustainable Development Goals and supporting universal health coverage. Ensuring universal access to scientific research publications that are publicly funded is fundamental for enabling better public health. Many institutions
        in the world are unable to access a large proportion of scientific information because they cannot afford the subscriptions that the journal publishers charge.[

, accessed 28 August 2019).]
cOAlition S is supported by several of WHO’s key stakeholders, including Member States, and donors such as the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the European Commission and the Wellcome Trust. By joining cOAlition S, WHO will align itself
        with the open-access principles and objectives of these stakeholders. As the first UN agency or intergovernmental organization to join this initiative, WHO intends to show strong leadership and provide a bold statement to the international public health community."
What are the requirements of Plan S?,"Researchers must publish in (1) open-access journals or platforms; or (2) in subscription journals (i) that allow authors to deposit the version of record or their accepted manuscript in a public repository immediately, under the terms of a Creative Commons Attribution licence (CC BY), or (ii) that are covered by a transformative agreement that has a clear and time-specified commitment to transition to full open access."
What is the impact of Plan S on WHO’s open-access policy?,WHO’s open-access policy will be updated in 2020 in accordance with the principles and implementation guidance of Plan S. The revised policy will enter into force on 1 January 2021. WHO will also update its grant agreements to reflect the new policy requirements.
"If I am a recipient of WHO funding, do I need to follow the requirements of Plan S?","If you submit your article to the journal publisher before 1 January 2021, the current WHO open-access policy will apply. Articles submitted on or after this date will be subject to the revised WHO open-access policy, to be developed in 2020."

"Today, Algeria was officially certified by WHO as malaria-free. How did the country achieve this milestone?","Algeria has an excellent healthcare system that extends even to remote areas of the country. All healthcare services, including malaria prevention, diagnosis and treatment, are provided free of charge to anyone within its borders including migrants.After eliminating indigenous malaria from the northern provinces of the country in 1993, Algeria shifted its focus south, where increased migration from neighbouring, malaria-endemic countries posed a key challenge to elimination efforts.Following the completion of the Algerian segment of the Trans-Saharan Highway in 1977, which linked Algeria to sub-Saharan Africa, population movement in neighbouring malaria-endemic countries contributed to increased transmission in Algeria’s southern provinces, resulting in several outbreaks of malaria in border areas; between 1977 and 2008, the annual number of malaria cases in Algeria rose from zero to an average of 250.Algeria was able to control and prevent sustained transmission of malaria through a robust, integrated surveillance system, a well-trained health workforce, effective vector control, universal health care, and a rapid response to outbreaks of the disease. In 2013, the country reported its last indigenous case of malaria."
What systems and strategies has Algeria adopted to stay malaria-free?,"The high quality of Algeria’s health system, coupled with the provision of free healthcare to everyone within its borders, will allow for effective prevention measures, as well as early diagnosis and treatment of all malaria cases.Faced with a significant rate of imported malaria cases from neighboring malaria-affected countries, particularly in the south, Algeria’s healthcare personnel will need to remain vigilant: suspected cases of malaria must be rapidly identified, tested and treated to prevent local disease transmission.The investigation of malaria cases by trained personnel, vector surveillance, and effective oversight by provincial and national health experts will help ensure that any local cases are quickly identified, and that appropriate actions are taken to prevent re-establishment of transmission."
What role did national leadership play in this success story? Did international partners also contribute to this effort?,"The commitment, leadership and expertise of 3 national partners – Algeria’s Ministry of Health, Population and Hospital Reform, the National Institute of Public Health, and the Pasteur Institute of Algeria – were essential to achieving this success. Through a collaborative effort that engaged additional academic partners, these 3 government agencies successfully implemented and monitored the country’s malaria elimination programme.The long-standing financial support of the national government was also key to success: Algeria has always fully funded its budget for malaria elimination through domestic financing.WHO at all levels has been a critical technical partner, especially in the last 3-year period (2016-2018) when the country was seeking elimination certification. WHO supported national efforts to update strategies and guidance on both malaria elimination and on the prevention of re-establishment of transmission."
How can Algeria be certified when it is bordered by three malaria-endemic countries and receiving hundreds of imported cases each year?,"Algeria reported its last indigenous case of malaria in 2013. Since that time, the country has proven capable of detecting, treating and responding to all imported malaria cases rapidly enough to prevent indigenous transmission from occurring.The presence of so many imported cases each year helps to keep Algeria’s healthcare system vigilant to the threat posed by malaria. It also helps maintain skills in diagnostic testing and treatment among health care personnel.Algeria’s open and accessible healthcare system means that visitors and migrants will be encouraged to seek and receive treatment any time they fall ill, reducing the chances that imported cases will go unnoticed and untreated."
How does Algeria stand to benefit from its new malaria-free status?,"Certification provides external validation that Algeria’s health care system is strong enough to eliminate a significant public health burden, and that the population of Algeria is no longer at risk of illness or death from this serious disease. In view of its malaria-free status, Algeria is expected to benefit from a growth in tourism and development in the country’s southern provinces."
What is the E-2020 initiative?,"In May 2015, the World Health Assembly endorsed a new Global Technical Strategy for Malaria 2016-2030, setting ambitious goals aimed at dramatically lowering the global malaria burden over this 15-year period, with milestones along the way to track progress. A key milestone for 2020 is the elimination of malaria in at least 10 countries that had the disease in 2015. To meet this target, countries must report zero indigenous cases in 2020.
According to a WHO analysis published in 2016, 21 countries have the potential to eliminate malaria by 2020. They were selected based on an analysis that looked at the likelihood of elimination across 3 key criteria:

trends in malaria case incidence between 2000 and 2014;
declared malaria objectives of affected countries; and
informed opinions of WHO experts in the field.

Together, these 21 malaria-eliminating countries are part of a concerted effort known as the E-2020 initiative, supported by WHO and other partners, to eliminate malaria in an ambitious but technically feasible time frame."
"If the global response to malaria is at a crossroads, why are we seeing some countries accelerate towards elimination?","Globally, progress in the malaria response has stalled: the declining trend in malaria cases and deaths has levelled off and even reversed in some regions. However, as highlighted in the World malaria report 2018, 46 countries reported less than 10 000 malaria cases in 2017, compared to just 37 countries in 2010.
This bright spot in the response shows that elimination of the disease is possible and that global efforts to control and prevent malaria have resulted in substantial declines in malaria cases and deaths. Now, it is important to focus on continuing to support both groups of countries: those with a high burden of malaria and those accelerating towards elimination."
Argentina and Uzbekistan have eliminated malaria: why are they not featured in the E-2020 report?,"The E-2020 report is focused on progress among 21 malaria-eliminating countries that were identified by WHO in 2016 as having the potential to eliminate the disease by 2020. At the time of the initiative’s development, Argentina and Uzbekistan were
    already too advanced in the elimination process to be included in the E-2020 group.Both countries have reported zero indigenous cases of malaria since 2011. Uzbekistan was officially certified malaria-free
    by WHO in December 2018 and Argentina attained this status in May 2019."
"Once a country achieves malaria elimination, does this mean there is no longer any need to focus on the disease?","The malaria elimination journey does not end with certification. Preventing re-establishment of malaria requires keeping robust technical capabilities and skilled know-how in place.The malaria elimination journey does not end with certification. Preventing re-establishment of malaria requires keeping robust technical capabilities and skilled know-how in place. In practical terms, this means maintaining up-to-date malaria surveillance
    systems and ensuring health workers at all levels, in both public and private sectors, are continuously trained on how to detect malaria and the procedures for diagnosis, notification, treatment and patient follow up – critical components to
    prevent the disease from coming back."
"For countries with a high burden of malaria, is elimination of the disease a possibility?","Yes. While elimination is undoubtedly a longer-term goal, it is the ultimate objective that all malaria-endemic countries should aim for. To support countries on the path towards elimination, the WHO Global Technical Strategy outlines the critical requirements needed to achieve and maintain elimination at every level of malaria transmission intensity in every endemic country, focusing on the need for:

country ownership,
tailored responses,
strengthened surveillance,
equity in access to health services, and
innovation in malaria control tools."
What is the Decade of Action (DoA)?,"The UN Decade of Action on Nutrition, under the normative 
framework of ICN2 and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, marks
 a new ambition and direction in global nutrition action: to eradicate 
hunger, end malnutrition in all its forms (undernutrition, micronutrient
 deficiencies, overweight or obesity) and reduce the burden of 
diet-related noncommunicable diseases in all age groups.The Decade will provide an umbrella for all relevant 
stakeholders voluntarily to consolidate and align nutrition actions 
across different sectors and facilitate policy processes across the 
areas identified in the ICN2 outcome documents.The Decade is an unprecedented opportunity for achieving 
nutrition impact at scale, with a collective vision of a healthier and 
more sustainable future.The vision of the Decade is of a world where all nutrition 
champions coordinate action and strengthen collaboration so that all 
people at all times and at all stages of life have access to affordable,
 diversified, safe and healthy diets.The Decade will work for a 10-year period within existing structures and available resources.

The UN Decade of Action on Nutrition is not an initiative; it is not a programme nor a project."
Why do we need a UN Decade of Action on Nutrition?,"Ending hunger and all forms of malnutrition is among the most 
urgent and pervasive development challenges. Most countries are burdened
 by more than one form of malnutrition or diet-related noncommunicable 
diseases. These forms may co-exist within the same country, community, 
household or individual.


Many families cannot afford enough nutrient rich foods, like 
fresh fruit and vegetables, legumes, meat and milk, while foods and 
drinks high in fat, sugar or salt are often cheap and readily available.The world is producing more than enough food to feed everyone.
 Yet one-third of food produced for human consumption is lost or wasted 
globally throughout the supply chain, from initial agricultural 
production to final individual food consumption.Prioritized and accelerated action-oriented efforts within the
 Decade will lead the world to meeting the World Health Assembly six 
global nutrition targets 2025 and the global diet-related 
noncommunicable diseases targets, and the many additional 
nutrition-relevant targets in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable 
Development."
Who is involved in the UN Decade of Action on Nutrition?,"The UN Decade of Action on Nutrition belongs to everyone and 
aims to involve all countries, regardless of their income, the nature of
 their malnutrition challenges and the characteristics of their food and
 health systems.
The Decade is a global collective effort driven by UN Members 
States and co-convened by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the 
United Nations (FAO) and the World Health Organization (WHO), in 
collaboration with the World Food Programme (WFP), the International 
Fund for Agriculture Development (IFAD) and the United Nations 
Children’s Fund (UNICEF).FAO and WHO, as co-convenors, will:promote policy dialogue at all levels;develop tools and instruments to support the implementation of programmes, policies, partnerships and investment; and
track and report on progress toward achieving global goals and country-specific commitments for action on nutrition.National governments and other relevant stakeholders, 
including international, intergovernmental and regional organizations, 
parliamentarians, civil society, academia and private sector all have an
 active role to play in the implementation of the Decade.In particular, the Committee on World Food Security (CFS) 
provides a vital multistakeholder platform where countries and their 
many partners can discuss progress, exchange lessons and experiences and
 agree on coherent and consistent food security and nutrition policies. 
The UN System Standing Committee on Nutrition (UNSCN) serves as a 
coordinating mechanism for the UN bodies and international organizations
 involved."
"For a country to achieve UHC, does it have to provide all interventions within the Repository?","Essential service packages vary across countries depending on current capacity, resource availability, and priorities. Expanding service provision in the context of UHC may entail starting with a smaller guaranteed package and then expanding the number of services covered."
How can I use the data in the Repository to inform Benefit Packages in my setting?,WHO provides guidance and tools to support priority setting and planning within a local context. See http://who.int/choice
Why is a specific intervention not in the Repository?,"This may be for a number of reasons: (i) WHO may have examined the evidence for the intervention but a decision was made not to recommend it (ii) WHO may have recommended the intervention a long time ago but has not issued recent recommendations (iii) WHO has not yet examined the evidence base for the intervention (iv) the intervention is considered a policy or system level investment and is thus not covered directly in the Repository database, but will be included in the accompanying inventory on facility and system investments."
How often will the Repository be updated?,"The data within the Repository will be updated on a regular basis to reflect updates in WHO published recommendations on interventions, to ensure the most up to date information is reflected."
What is the meaning of the two categories of WHO documents within the Compendium database? (WHO GRC-approved guideline and Other WHO reference documents),"WHO produces different types of guidance documents. The Guidelines review committee (GRC) and its Secretariat support guideline developers and ensure the quality of a certain type of guidance document produced by WHO, via an internal, peer-review process.  In addition, WHO produces a wide range of publications that contain guidance on clinical and public health interventions and policies, many of which are not suitable for review by the GRC.  When such guidance is linked to an intervention in the Compendium it is referred to as “other WHO reference documents”  within the database .  The importance of an intervention is not determined by the type of guidance document listed in the Compendium. Rather, Member States should select interventions prioritized to their needs, from across the items in the Compendium."
Are there specific events on the UN Decade of Action on Nutrition and/ or key opportunities to share and discuss progress towards ending all forms of malnutrition?,"FAO and WHO will work with the widest possible range of social
 actors and institutions, taking the opportunity to build upon and 
connect already planned events and to organize new bridge-building 
events to
promote the Decade and its aims. On 20 September 2016 the co-convenors 
launched a major consultation process to develop the work programme of 
the Decade.A series of consultations through coordination mechanisms such
 as UNSCN and multistakeholder platforms such as CFS, on-line forums and
 face-to-face meetings are being prepared to engage as many stakeholders
 as possible in the strategic process of developing the work programme. 
Participants will be invited to share views and ideas as well as receive
 feedback from countries and stakeholders on their expectations for the 
upcoming ten years.Many countries and other actors are already strongly committed
 to existing food and nutrition initiatives, mechanisms, alliances, 
movements or partnerships. These efforts will provide the structure for 
action. The umbrella of the Decade creates a framework for sharing 
experiences, promoting improved coordination by the participants 
themselves, and building political momentum for scaled up global action.
The Decade will facilitate North-South, South-South and triangular cooperation and learning."
How is the work programme for the UN Decade of Action on Nutrition being prepared and implemented?,"The work programme of the Decade will be a global programme but with action at the country level.
Setting out the work programme of the Decade will be an 
inclusive, continuous, and collaborative process, building upon and 
connecting the independent initiatives of governments and their many 
partners.Advocating for commitments by all stakeholders to implement 
specific interventions, policies, programmes and investments for action 
on nutrition in all relevant sectors will be crucial in order to bring 
about a real and meaningful system change to end all forms of 
malnutrition. The Decade will provide a standardized global framework 
for making, reporting and monitoring progress and for tracking results.All stakeholders are invited to submit inputs to the work 
programme of the Decade, taking as reference the six pillars identified 
in the ICN2 Framework for Action. These six pillars are:sustainable food systems for healthy diets;



aligned health systems providing universal coverage of essential nutrition actions;social protection and nutrition education;trade and investment for improved nutrition;
enabling food and breastfeeding environments; and
review, strengthen and promote nutrition governance and accountability.Stakeholders are encouraged to set, track and achieve 
specific, measurable, achievable, relevant and time-bound (SMART) 
commitments. This will help all stakeholders understand what action is 
intended and
improve tracking.Three groups of catalytic mechanisms will support the progress
 on nutrition commitments across the Decade: evidence informed advocacy,
 convening platforms and accountability mechanisms."
How is the UN Decade of Action on Nutrition contributing to the achievement of Agenda 2030 and its Sustainable Development Goals?,"With the adoption of the Agenda 2030 and its Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDGs) at the UN General Assembly in September 2015, 
world leaders committed to rid the world of the twin scourges of poverty
 and hunger and set out a vision for a fairer, more inclusive, 
prosperous, peaceful and sustainable world in which no one is left 
behind. SDG 2 in particular, aims to end hunger, achieve food security 
and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture.The achievement of the 2030 SDGs will only be met when much 
greater political focus is given towards improving nutrition, as 
nutrition is both an input and outcome of sustainable development.The UN Decade of Action on Nutrition provides an opportunity 
for all partners to work together, mobilize action and accelerate fforts
 towards the elimination of hunger, food insecurity and all forms of 
malnutrition and meeting the SDGs by 2030."
"For interventions listed on the Compendium web-site, what does “Reference document under review” mean?","When WHO has not published specific guidance on a listed intervention, the intervention is labelled “Reference document under review”.  This means that the intervention is considered important to include, but there is currently no WHO guidance published."
When will an extended version of the database be posted?,"The current version of the database includes selected information on intervention tags, target populations and service delivery platforms. WHO is currently working to expand the database both in terms of breadth (number of interventions) and depth (information shown for each intervention). Updates will be published later in 2020."

What’s the best advice for staying safe during a heatwave?,"To protect yourself during a heatwave, you should:Move to the coolest room in the home, especially at night. If it is not possible to keep your home cool, spend 2-3 hours of the day in a cool place (such as an airconditioned public building). Avoid going outside during the hottest time of the day. Avoid strenuous physical activity if you can. If you must do strenuous activity, do it during the coolest part of the day, which is usually in the morning between 04:00 and 07:00. Stay in the shade. Do not leave children or animals in parked vehicles."
How do I keep my body cool during a heatwave?,"Keep the body cool and hydrated by taking cool showers or baths during a heatwave. You can also use cold packs and wraps, towels, sponging, and foot baths to keep cool. Wear light, loose-fitting clothes of natural materials. If you go outside, wear a wide-brimmed hat or cap and sunglasses. Use light bed linen and sheets, and no cushions, to avoid heat accumulation. Drink regularly, but avoid alcohol and too much caffeine and sugar. Eat small meals and eat more often. Avoid foods that are high in protein."
What should I do if I feel unwell during a heatwave?,"If you feel dizzy, weak, anxious or have intense thirst and headache during a heatwave, it is best to move to a cool place as soon as possible and measure your body temperature. Drink some water or fruit juice to rehydrate. Rest immediately in a cool place if you have painful muscular spasms (particularly in the legs, arms or abdomen), and drink oral rehydration solutions containing electrolytes. Medical attention is needed if heat cramps last more than 1 hour. Consult your doctor if you feel unusual symptoms or if symptoms persist.If one of your family members or people you assist presents hot dry skin and delirium, convulsions and/or unconsciousness, call a doctor/ambulance immediately. While waiting for help, move the person to a cool place, put him or her in a horizontal position and elevate legs and hips, remove clothing and initiate external cooling, for example, by placing cold packs on the neck, axillae and groin, fanning continuously and spraying the skin with water at 25–30 °C. Measure the body temperature. Do not give acetylsalicylic acid or paracetamol. Position an unconscious person on his or her side."
How do I keep my home cool during a heatwave?,"During a heatwave you should aim to keep your living space cool. Check the room temperature between 08:00 and 10:00, at 13:00 and at night after 22:00. Ideally, the room temperature should be kept below 32 °C during the day and 24 °C during the night. This is especially important for infants or adults over the age of 60 or who have chronic health conditions. At night and early morning when the outside temperature is lower, open all the windows and shutters in your home. During the day, close the windows and shutters (if available), especially those facing the sun during the day. Turn off artificial lighting and as many electrical devices as possible. Hang shades, draperies, awnings or louvers on windows that receive morning or afternoon sun. Hang wet towels to cool down the room air. Note that the humidity of the air increases at the same time.If your residence is air conditioned, close the doors and windows and conserve electricity not needed to keep you cool, to ensure that power remains available and reduce the chance of a community-wide outage. Electric fans may provide relief, but when the temperature is above 35 °C, may not prevent heat-related illness. It is important to drink fluids."
Why did WHO establish a Strategic Advisory Group on malaria eradication (SAGme)?,"In 2016, at the request of the former Director-General, Dr Margaret Chan, WHO established a Strategic Advisory Group to tackle
    the big question of malaria eradication, a topic that sparks passions, opinions, excitement and concerns. Dr Chan felt that WHO should have a position on eradication and that it should be based on a thorough and authoritative study rooted in a deep analysis of past and future malaria trends. The group, made up of scientists and public health experts from around the world, came together to advise WHO on what malaria might look like in the future as well as the feasibility of eradication."
What is WHO’s current position on malaria eradication?,"Remember that WHO embraced the goal of malaria eradication soon after it was founded in 1948. In 1955, a first Global Malaria Eradication Programme (GMEP) was launched. This commitment to eradication was reaffirmed in a World Health Assembly resolution
    of 1969, and later reinforced in 2015 through the Assembly’s endorsement of the Global technical strategy for malaria 2016-2030 (GTS).
 It clearly spells out the vision of a malaria-free world."
What were the group’s main findings about malaria eradication?,"The key finding is that a malaria-free world would mean millions of lives saved and a return on investment of billions of dollars.Global megatrends related to climate, urbanisation, agricultural use patterns, electrification mean that malaria will be radically reduced in many areas but remain entrenched in others.Yet even with our most positive projections, if we use our current tools to fight malaria, we will still have 11 million cases of malaria in Africa in 2050. No one can formulate a precise and reliable plan for the eradication of human malaria nor calculate what it will cost. SAGme concluded that, especially with the stalling of process over the past 2 years, we must get the world back on track to meet the GTS targets. To do this, we need a renewed drive towards research and development, including on malaria vaccines and other approaches and tools.We also need political leaders to ensure everyone has access to affordable health care. And we must invest in robust and agile surveillance systems to detect changes in malaria transmission so that we can better target the response. Eradication is still the global vision."
What is vaccination?,"Vaccination is a simple, safe, and effective way of protecting people against harmful diseases, before they come into contact with them. It uses your body’s natural defenses to build resistance to specific infections and makes your immune system stronger. 
Vaccines train your immune system to create antibodies, just as it does when it’s exposed to a disease. However, because vaccines contain only killed or weakened forms of germs like viruses or bacteria, they do not cause the disease or put you at risk of its complications.
Most vaccines are given by an injection, but some are given orally (by mouth) or sprayed into the nose."
How does a vaccine work?,"Vaccines reduce risks of getting a disease by working with your body’s natural defenses to build protection. When you get a vaccine, your immune system responds. It:


Recognizes the invading germ, such as the virus or bacteria.


Produces antibodies. Antibodies are proteins produced naturally by the immune system to fight disease. 


Remembers the disease and how to fight it. If you are then exposed to the germ in the future, your immune system can quickly destroy it before you become unwell.


The vaccine is therefore a safe and clever way to produce an immune response in the body, without causing illness.
Our immune systems are designed to remember. Once exposed to one or more doses of a vaccine, we typically remain protected against a disease for years, decades or even a lifetime. This is what makes vaccines so effective. Rather than treating a disease after it occurs, vaccines prevent us in the first instance from getting sick."
Why should I get vaccinated?,"Without vaccines, we are at risk of serious illness and disability from diseases like measles, meningitis, pneumonia, tetanus and polio. Many of these diseases can be life-threatening. WHO estimates that vaccines save between 2 and 3 million lives every year.
Although some diseases may have become uncommon, the germs that cause them continue to circulate in some or all parts of the world. In today’s world, infectious diseases can easily cross borders, and infect anyone who is not protected
 Two key reasons to get vaccinated are to protect ourselves and to protect those around us. Because not everyone can be vaccinated – including very young babies, those who are seriously ill or have certain allergies – they depend on others being vaccinated to ensure they are also safe from vaccine-preventable diseases."
What diseases do vaccines prevent?,"Vaccines protect against many different diseases, including:

Cervical cancer
Cholera
Diphtheria
Hepatitis B
Influenza
Japanese encephalitis
Measles
Meningitis
Mumps
Pertussis
Pneumonia
Polio
Rabies
Rotavirus
Rubella
Tetanus
Typhoid
Varicella
Yellow fever


Some other vaccines are currently under development or being piloted, including those that protect against Ebola or malaria, but are not yet widely available globally.

Not all of these vaccinations may be needed in your country. Some may only be given prior to travel, in areas of risk, or to people in high-risk occupations. Talk to your healthcare worker to find out what vaccinations are needed for you and your family.


Should my daughter get vaccinated against human papillomavirus (HPV)?

Virtually all cervical cancer cases start with a sexually transmitted HPV infection. If given before exposure to the virus, vaccination offers the best protection against this disease. Following vaccination, reductions of up to 90% in HPV infections in teenage girls and young women have been demonstrated by studies conducted in Australia, Belgium, Germany, New Zealand, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States of America.
In studies, the HPV vaccine has been shown to be safe and effective. WHO recommends that all girls aged 9–14 years receive 2 doses of the vaccine, alongside cervical cancer screening later in life."
What is hepatitis?,"Hepatitis is an inflammation of the liver. The condition can be self-limiting or can progress to fibrosis (scarring), cirrhosis or liver cancer. Hepatitis viruses are the most common cause of hepatitis in the world but other infections, toxic substances (e.g. alcohol, certain drugs), and autoimmune diseases can also cause hepatitis.
There are 5 main hepatitis viruses, referred to as types A, B, C, D and E. These 5 types are of greatest concern because of the burden of illness and death they cause and the potential for outbreaks and epidemic spread. In particular, types B and C lead to chronic disease in hundreds of millions of people and, together, are the most common cause of liver cirrhosis and cancer. Hepatitis A and E are typically caused by ingestion of contaminated food or water. Hepatitis B, C and D usually occur as a result of parenteral contact with infected body fluids. Common modes of transmission for these viruses include receipt of contaminated blood or blood products, invasive medical procedures using contaminated equipment and for hepatitis B transmission from mother to baby at birth, from family member to child, and also by sexual contact. Acute infection may occur with limited or no symptoms, or may include symptoms such as jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes), dark urine, extreme fatigue, nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain."
What are the different hepatitis viruses?,"Scientists have identified 5 unique hepatitis viruses, identified by the letters A, B, C, D, and E. While all cause liver disease, they vary in important ways.


Hepatitis A virus (HAV) is present in the faeces of infected persons and is most often transmitted through consumption of contaminated water or food. Certain sex practices can also spread HAV. Infections are in many cases mild, with most people making a full recovery and remaining immune from further HAV infections. However, HAV infections can also be severe and life threatening. Most people in areas of the world with poor sanitation have been infected with this virus. Safe and effective vaccines are available to prevent HAV. 

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is transmitted through exposure to infective blood, semen, and other body fluids. HBV can be transmitted from infected mothers to infants at the time of birth or from family member to infant in early childhood. Transmission may also occur through transfusions of HBV-contaminated blood and blood products, contaminated injections during medical procedures, and through injection drug use. HBV also poses a risk to healthcare workers who sustain accidental needle stick injuries while caring for infected-HBV patients. Safe and effective vaccines are available to prevent HBV. 

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is mostly transmitted through exposure to infective blood. This may happen through transfusions of HCV-contaminated blood and blood products, contaminated injections during medical procedures, and through injection drug use. Sexual transmission is also possible, but is much less common. There is no vaccine for HCV.

Hepatitis D virus (HDV) infections occur only in those who are infected with HBV. The dual infection of HDV and HBV can result in a more serious disease and worse outcome. Hepatitis B vaccines provide protection from HDV infection.

Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is mostly transmitted through consumption of contaminated water or food. HEV is a common cause of hepatitis outbreaks in developing parts of the world and is increasingly recognized as an important cause of disease in developed countries. Safe and effective vaccines to prevent HEV infection have been developed but are not widely available."
What is the difference between elimination and eradication?,"This definition has changed over the years. Currently, we call elimination the interruption of transmission in a given geographical area; usually we refer to a country. Eradication means that all countries have eliminated malaria and there is complete
    interruption of malaria transmission globally, with zero cases across the globe."
"Does WHO’s advisory group think that malaria can be truly eradicated, as is the case with smallpox?","The answer is yes. There is no specific biological or environmental barrier to malaria eradication. However, do we have the tools, programmes and financing that could actually drive an eradication effort now? The answer is no.  A successful eradication effort will require tools that we don’t have today. This speaks to the critical importance of an accelerated research and development agenda."
Why is it taking so long to eradicate malaria?,"We are fighting a very complex parasite - one that can be transmitted by certain mosquito vectors very efficiently. Malaria roots itself in the heartland of Africa and affects some of the harder-to-reach and more impoverished populations. To date, the disease has received insufficient attention in the research and development space, and insufficient investment to roll out available tools, particularly in countries with weak health systems."
What is the WHO doing now to fight malaria in areas hardest hit by malaria?,"WHO and the RBM Partnership to End Malaria are driving the country-led High burden to high impact (HBHI) approach.
 It will initially focus on getting the 11 highest burden counties - 10 of which are in Africa - back on track to achieve the GTS targets for 2025.By taking this approach, countries will enable real impact in the fight against malaria. The concrete outcomes we are aiming for include more resources freed up by political leaders, better use of information, stronger technical guidance and a more coordinated
    response to malaria. We will roll out the HBHI approach to all malarious countries in Africa as we progress towards a malaria-free continent."
Some experts think that we should have a target date for the malaria eradication goal as we do for some other public health goals. Why can’t we work towards a target date to eradicate malaria?,"If we consider smallpox, the burden of the disease was relatively low when WHO launched an eradication campaign in 1967. At the time, we had a highly efficacious vaccine and could actually foresee an end date.  When the polio eradication campaign was launched in 1988, there were an estimated 330 000 cases of the disease and we had a highly effective vaccine. The campaign originally had a 12 or 15-year timeline. However, 30 years later, despite massive progress,
    the job has still not been completed.  In the case of malaria, we have more than 200 million cases annually, and we don’t have optimal tools. The SAGme believes that setting a date now, when there are so many uncertainties, may actually be counterproductive. Instead, the group is calling
    for an accelerated effort to achieve the already-approved targets of the GTS, a framework that includes 5-year targets for reductions in malaria cases and deaths through 2030.  Following this alternative approach will actually take us along the path towards eradication. We can assess our progress at five-year intervals and eventually determine the tipping point -- when a time-limited, credible, achievable campaign to fully eradicate
    malaria could be launched. We are clearly not there yet."
When should I get vaccinated (or vaccinate my child)?,"Vaccines protect us throughout life and at different ages, from birth to childhood, as teenagers and into old age. In most countries you will be given a vaccination card that tells you what vaccines you or your child have had and when the next vaccines or booster doses are due. It is important to make sure that all these vaccines are up to date.
 If we delay vaccination, we are at risk of getting seriously sick. If we wait until we think we may be exposed to a serious illness – like during a disease outbreak – there may not be enough time for the vaccine to work and to receive all the recommended doses.

Why does vaccination start at such a young age?


Young children can be exposed to diseases in their daily life from many different places and people, and this can put them at serious risk. The WHO-recommended vaccination schedule is designed to protect infants and young children as early as possible. Infants and young children are often at the greatest risk from diseases because their immune systems are not yet fully developed, and their bodies are less able to fight off infection. It is therefore very important that children are vaccinated against diseases at the recommended time.

I didn't vaccinate my child at the recommended time. Is it too late to catch up?


For most vaccines, it’s never too late to catch up. Talk to your healthcare worker about how to get any missed vaccination doses for yourself or your child."
Who can get vaccinated?,"Nearly everyone can get vaccinated. However, because of some medical conditions, some people should not get certain vaccines, or should wait before getting them. These conditions can include:


Chronic illnesses or treatments (like chemotherapy) that affect the immune system; 


Severe and life-threatening allergies to vaccine ingredients, which are very rare;


If you have severe illness and a high fever on the day of vaccination.


These factors often vary for each vaccine. If you’re not sure if you or your child should get a particular vaccine, talk to your health worker. They can help you make an informed choice about vaccination for you or your child."
What is in a vaccine?,"All the ingredients of a vaccine play an important role in ensuring a vaccine is safe and effective. Some of these include:


The antigen. This is a killed or weakened form of a virus or bacteria, which trains our bodies to recognize and fight the disease if we encounter it in the future. 


Adjuvants, which help to boost our immune response. This means they help vaccines to work better.


Preservatives, which ensure a vaccine stays effective.


Stabilisers, which protect the vaccine during storage and transportation.


Vaccine ingredients can look unfamiliar when they are listed on a label. However, many of the components used in vaccines occur naturally in the body, in the environment, and in the foods we eat. All of the ingredients in vaccines – as well as the vaccines themselves - are thoroughly tested and monitored to ensure they are safe."
Are vaccines safe?,"Vaccination is safe and side effects from a vaccine are usually minor and temporary, such as a sore arm or mild fever. More serious side effects are possible, but extremely rare.
Any licensed vaccine is rigorously tested across multiple phases of trials before it is approved for use, and regularly reassessed once it is introduced. Scientists are also constantly monitoring information from several sources for any sign that a vaccine may cause health risks.
 Remember, you are far more likely to be seriously injured by a vaccine-preventable disease than by a vaccine. For example, tetanus can cause extreme pain, muscle spasms (lockjaw) and blood clots, measles can cause encephalitis (an infection of the brain) and blindness. Many vaccine-preventable diseases can even result in death. The benefits of vaccination greatly outweigh the risks, and many more illnesses and deaths would occur without vaccines.

Are there side effects from vaccines?


Like any medicine, vaccines can cause mild side effects, such as a low-grade fever, or pain or redness at the injection site. Mild reactions go away within a few days on their own. 
Severe or long-lasting side effects are extremely rare. Vaccines are continually monitored for safety, to detect rare adverse events.
 
Can a child be given more than one vaccine at a time?

Scientific evidence shows that giving several vaccines at the same time has no negative effect. Children are exposed to several hundred foreign substances that trigger an immune response every day. The simple act of eating food introduces new germs into the body, and numerous bacteria live in the mouth and nose. 
When a combined vaccination is possible (e.g. for diphtheria, pertussis and tetanus), this means fewer injections and reduces discomfort for the child. It also means that your child is getting the right vaccine at the right time, to avoid the risk of contracting a potentially deadly disease.
 
Is there a link between vaccines and autism?


There is no evidence of any link between vaccines and autism or autistic disorders. This has been demonstrated in many studies, conducted across very large populations.
The 1998 study which raised concerns about a possible link between measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine and autism was later found to be seriously flawed and fraudulent. The paper was subsequently retracted by the journal that published it, and the doctor that published it lost his medical license. Unfortunately, its publication created fear that led to dropping immunization rates in some countries, and subsequent outbreaks of these diseases.
We must all ensure we are taking steps to share only credible, scientific information on vaccines, and the diseases they prevent."
I still have questions about vaccination. What should I do?,"If you have questions about vaccines be sure to talk to your healthcare worker. He or she can provide you with science-based advice about vaccination for you and your family, including the recommended vaccination schedule in your country.
When looking online for information about vaccines, be sure to consult only trustworthy sources. To help you find them, WHO has reviewed and ‘certified’ many websites across the world that provide only information based on reliable scientific evidence and independent reviews by leading technical experts. These websites are all members of the Vaccine Safety Net."
What is Make Listening Safe initiative?,"WHO estimates that 1.1 billion young people worldwide are at risk of hearing loss due to unsafe listening practices. This includes exposure to loud sounds on personal audio devices and in noisy entertainment venues. In order to address this concern, WHO has launched the Make Listening Safe initiative. This initiative aims to reduce hearing loss caused by listening to loud sounds by promoting safe listening."
How is loudness measured? What is dB?,"The unit of measurement used to express the intensity of a sound is the decibel (dB). A whisper is around 30 dB and normal conversation approximately 60 dB. Some common sounds and their intensities (dB) are indicated below.




Device/situation

The intensity of sound and the duration of exposure contribute to the overall sound energy level to which the individual is exposed; in other words, your risk of losing your hearing depends on how loud, for how long and how often you are exposed to loud sounds"
What are the causes?,"In some cases, pulmonary hypertension is caused by schistosomiasis, a worm infection which is common in Africa and Latin America; and sickle cell disease, a genetic abnormality of blood which is common in persons of African origin."
What are the symptoms,"Difficulty in breathing or shortness of breath is the main symptom of pulmonary hypertension. Other symptoms are fatigue, dizziness, swelling in the ankles or legs (edema), bluish lips and skin (cyanosis), chest pain, racing pulse and palpitations."
What is pulmonary hypertension?,"Pulmonary hypertension is a condition in which there is high blood pressure in the lung arteries. How the disease starts is not always clear, but the arteries become narrow and there is less room for the blood to flow.
Over time, some of the arteries may stiffen and become completely blocked. The narrowing of the pulmonary arteries causes the right side of heart to work harder to pump blood through the lungs. Over time, the heart muscle weakens and loses its ability to pump enough blood for the body's needs. The extra stress causes the heart to enlarge and become less flexible. Heart failure is one of the most common causes of death in people who have pulmonary hypertension."
Is there any treatment?,"Acute sinusitis usually subsides without any need for specific treatment. Chronic sinusitis may require antibiotics, decongestants or steroid nasal sprays."
What are the causes?,"Allergic rhinitis is triggered by allergens. Allergens can be found both outdoors and indoors. When allergic rhinitis is caused by outdoor allergens, e.g., mould or trees, grass and weed pollens — it is often referred to as seasonal allergies, or “hay fever”. Allergic rhinitis may also be triggered by allergens found in the home, such as animal dander, indoor mould, or house dust mites. The most current classification of allergic rhinitis, tough, takes into consideration the intensity of symptoms and the impact on quality of life. According to these characteristics it may be mild or moderate/severe."
What is allergic rhinitis?,"Allergic rhinitis, or hay fever, happens when you breathe in something to which you are allergic, and the inside of your nose becomes inflamed and swollen.Sinusitis is an inflammation of the lining inside the sinuses which can be acute or chronic. When the sinuses become blocked and fill with fluid, germs can grow and cause symptoms such as headache and nasal yellowish secretions. Blocked sinuses can be caused by the common cold, hay fever or nasal polyps (small lumps inside the nose). Allergic rhinitis and sinusitis are linked to each other, because allergic rhinitis causes your nose to become blocked, and in turn blocks the sinuses."
What is obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome?,"Obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome is a clinical disorder marked by frequent pauses in breathing during sleep usually accompanied by loud snoring. These pauses cut off the oxygen supply to your body for a few seconds and halt the removal of carbon dioxide. As a result of this, your brain briefly wakes you up, re-opens the airways and re-starts breathing. This can occur many times during the night and makes proper sleep impossible. During the day you may experience excessive daytime sleepiness, difficulty in concentrating or headaches. At night, snoring is the most common feature."
What is the diagnosis and how do you manage?,"Obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome is diagnosed through polysomnography, a method of recording body activity during sleep; and pulse oximetry, which measures the amount of oxygen in the blood at any time. Obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome is not a life-threatening condition in itself, but it can result in serious problems such as cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. The disease can impact on the quality of life, but can be easily managed. One of the treatments is continuous positive airway pressure, which forces air through a mask into the airways so that they do not close."
What is safe listening?,"The term safe listening simply refers to a specific listening behaviour that does not put your hearing at risk. Your risk of losing your hearing depends on how loud, for how long and how often you are exposed to loud sounds. These may be through personal audio devices or in entertainment venues as well as in the environment around you such as in traffic, in the workplace or at home.
Sensory cells can tolerate only a certain amount of daily noise before being damaged: this amount is called the daily sound allowance. If your cells are exposed to too much sound, you exceed your daily sound allowance which harms your ears and hearing. Over time this results in hearing loss.
Your daily sound allowance works like a monetary allowance or pocket money: you have a limited amount to spend each day. For example, the louder or longer you are exposed to high levels of sound, the more you “spend”, the faster you run out of your allowance.
To practice safe listening, you must stay within the limits of your allowance. On your personal audio device this can be easily done with the help of software that monitors your daily sound allowance. It is more difficult to monitor exposure to loud sounds in entertainment venues or the environment generally.
Hence, to practice safe listening, you should:

Always stay within your permissible daily sound allowance.
On some days you may visit noisy places such as a arenas hosting sporting events or concerts, discotheques, bars or even a fitness class with loud music. The high level of sound in these places also affects your daily sound allowance. For this reason, you should avoid the additional use of your ear/headphones on these days. If you choose to listen, you should reduce your listening volume and your listening time to make sure you do not exceed your daily sound allowance. Listening at a level of 80 dB for 40 hours per week can help you to listen safely.
If you are exposed to sound in your workplace, you must take extra care and ensure that you stay well within your recommended sound allowance.


Check out this video to learn more about safe listening levels and times:"
How do loud sounds affect my ears?,"Ears are the organs that process sounds, enabling the brain to interpret what you are hearing. Sensory cells within your ears help you listen. Listening to loud sounds over long periods of time can cause damage which can result in temporary or permanent hearing loss or a ringing sensation in the ear (tinnitus).
The hearing loss may not be noticeable initially. You may only have trouble hearing some high-pitched sounds like bells. Continued listening at unsafe levels leads to irreversible hearing loss. This can make it difficult to communicate with others, especially in noisy places like restaurants and markets."
How can I tell if my hearing has been affected?,"Hearing loss can be temporary or permanent. For example, a person who attends a loud concert may come out feeling slightly deaf or experiencing tinnitus. This is a temporary hearing loss and hearing in this case usually recovers within a few hours or a day. Regular or prolonged noise exposure can cause gradual, irreversible damage to the sensory cells, leading to permanent hearing loss. While temporary hearing loss gives no indication of the degree of permanent hearing loss that might eventually be experienced, it is a good predictor of the early development of permanent hearing loss.
Therefore, it is important to be alert to early warning signs of hearing loss:

ringing in the ears (tinnitus);
difficulty in hearing high-pitched sounds (birds singing, doorbells, telephones, alarm clocks);
difficulty understanding speech, especially over the telephone;
difficulty following conversations in noisy environments, such as in restaurants, markets or at social gatherings.

If you think that you have any of these problems, you should get your hearing checked. WHO has developed the hearWHO app so you can check your hearing anytime you want."
Once I have lost my hearing can I get it back?,"Lengthy exposure to noise in discotheques, bars, arenas hosting sporting events or concerts has been known to result in a sensation of sound in the ears known as tinnitus. Normally tinnitus recovers within a short time. If the exposure of loud sounds continues for a long time, this can lead to permanent hearing loss which involves the damage of sensory cells. Once damaged, sensory cells which are responsible for hearing, cannot regenerate. There is no medical or surgical cure for noise-induced hearing loss.
However, hearing loss is usually slow in onset, but progresses for as long as the exposure continues. The progression of hearing loss can be prevented by avoiding loud sounds and practicing safe listening (see Question 2)."
Is there a way to monitor my listening levels on the mobile phone?,"Smartphone apps are available that allow you to track your in-ear sound exposure while listening to music. Normally, if you increase the volume above a certain threshold, apps prompt a message to help you adhere to safe listening levels. These apps can be downloaded on your phone and used every time you listen to music with your headphones."
What is WHO doing to promote safe listening through personal audio devices?,"In 2015 WHO launched the Make Listening Safe initiative with the overall vision to ensure that people of all ages can enjoy listening with the full protection of their hearing. The objective of the initiative is to reduce the risk of hearing loss posed by exposure to unsafe levels of sound in entertainment venues and to ensure that listeners of all ages can listen to music safely on their personal audio devices. As part of this initiative WHO, in collaboration with the International Telecommunications Union (ITU), has developed the global standard for safe listening personal audio devices. Once adopted by governments and manufacturers, this standard will ensure that personal audio devices on the market facilitate users’ safe listening behaviours.
When choosing your personal audio devices, you will then be able to ask for devices that comply with this global standard."
What can I do to make my listening safe?,"Keep the volume down, by staying within the 80 dB limit as far as possible for no longer than 40 hours per week.
Wear earplugs when visiting discotheques, bars, arenas hosting sporting events and concerts other noisy places.
Use noise-cancelling earphones/headphones, as these can reduce the need to raise the volume when you are in a noisy environment, such as when travelling on a train or bus.
Monitor and respect safe listening levels, and stay within your daily sound allowance.
Limit the daily use of your personal audio devices.
Limit time spent engaged in activities in noisy places:
    
take short listening breaks (go to a quiet place or corner and allow your ears to rest)
move away from loud sounds by keeping a distance between yourself and the sound source such as speakers
reduce your frequency of visiting noisy places, if possible.


Get regular hearing check-ups.

What are the causes?,"The cause of bronchiectasis is often not clear. Some conditions that affect or damage airways can cause the disease, for example: Some inherited conditions. For example, a condition called primary ciliary dyskinesia affects the cilia so they do not 'move' correctly to clear the mucus. Cystic fibrosis is another condition that affects the lungs and causes bronchiectasis. Inhaled objects can become stuck and block an airway. This may lead to local damage to that airway. Acid from the stomach that is regurgitated and inhaled can damage airways as well as inhaling poisonous gases.Severe lung infections such as tuberculosis (TB), whooping cough, pneumonia or measles can damage the airways at the time of infection. Bronchiectasis may then develop."
What is bronchiectasis?,"Bronchiectasis is an abnormal widening of one or more airways. Normally, tiny glands in the lining of the airways make a small amount of mucus. Mucus keeps the airways moist and  traps any dust and dirt in the inhaled air. Because bronchiectasis creates an abnormal widening of the airways, extra mucus tends to form and pool in parts of the widened airways. Widened airways with extra mucus are prone to infection."
What is the symptom?,"The main symptom of bronchiectasis is a cough which produces a lot of sputum, tiredness and poor concentration as well as wheeziness. A lung scan and other lung and sputum tests help to confirm the diagnosis. Treatment includes regular physiotherapy, which helps coughing up and clearing the mucus, and courses of antibiotics. Surgery is occasionally needed."
What is polio?,"Poliomyelitis (polio) is a highly infectious disease caused by the poliovirus. It invades the nervous system and can cause paralysis, or even death, in a matter of hours."
How is polio transmitted?,"Polio is transmitted mainly through the faecal-oral route. For example, if someone touches human waste contaminated with the virus, and then eats food without washing their hands properly, the virus could enter the body through the mouth.

The virus multiplies in the intestine and is excreted by the infected person in their faeces, which can pass the virus onto others."
Is there a cure for polio?,"No, there is no cure for polio. Polio can only be prevented by immunization.

Two safe and effective vaccines exist—the oral polio vaccine (OPV) which is given as drops into the mouth and the inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) which is given by injection. Both provide essential protection for children against polio and, given multiple times, they protect a child for life."
Am I at risk from polio? Are my children at risk?,"Polio mainly affects children under the age of 5 years, although the disease occasionally affects adults. The best protection for your children is vaccination."
What can I do as a parent to ensure safe listening?,As parents you need to play an active role in educating your children about safe listening and monitoring their exposure to loud noise; you also need to be role models of safe listening for your children. You should make sure that your children avoid the use of headphones when possible and use only headphones that provide information about the risks for hearing loss. Parents should also ensure that their children do not increase the volume when they are not supervised. Some devices may be equipped with parental control that allows parents to control the loudness level of the device.
What can I do as a teacher to ensure safe listening?,As a teacher you can educate children and adolescents about the possible dangers of exposure to loud sounds from the misuse of personal audio devices and be encouraged to develop safe listening habits. Such information should be part of the health education curriculum and also be taught as part of music and dance classes.
What can I do as a physician to ensure safe listening?,"You may have a significant opportunity to educate and counsel adolescents and young adults regarding hearing protection. You can convey appropriate messages about the risks and promote healthy listening habits among users. You can also advise people about the importance of regular hearing checks and guide them about where and how they can get these. If you suspect that any person has hearing loss, they should be referred to the proper health facility where they can receive diagnostic and rehabilitative services."
What can I do as a manager of an entertainment venue to ensure safe listening?,"Managers of venues in which noise levels are high – nightclubs, discotheques, bars, pubs, cinemas, concerts, sporting events and even fitness classes – have an important role to play in ensuring the personal safety of people who frequent such venues. To make listening safe, you can: monitor and apply the safe noise limit set by the establishment itself; make use of sound limiters to control noise levels in such settings; provide free earplugs to all patrons along with information about their proper use as well as “chill out” rooms, where volume levels are monitored and safe; and prominently display messages about the risk of hearing loss during moments when the volume goes beyond safe levels."
What can I do as a manufacturer of personal audio devices to ensure safe listening?,"As a manufacturer of personal audio devices, you will have the technical know-how to design these devices with appropriate safety features. For example, devices can display an on-screen message displaying the average dB level at different volume settings, along with a warning to keep the output below 80 dB. Such measures offer protection and help raise awareness about the harmful effects of loud music and other noise. You can also provide prominent warning labels on the products themselves, as well as on the external packaging and accompanying information materials."
What can governments do to ensure safe listening?,"Governments are encouraged to develop stricter laws and rigorously enforce already existing legislation regarding non-occupational noise. They should ensure that the personal audio devices available in the country should comply with existing safe listening standard. Governments must also raise awareness about the issue through targeted public information campaigns highlighting the potential consequences of hearing loss.
Efforts should be made to made to integrate ear and hearing care into the health care strategy of the country. Such efforts must focus on prevention of hearing loss as well as its early identification and appropriate management. Governments can ensure that hearing devices and services required by people with hearing loss should be accessible to them, as part of universal health coverage."
What is dengue fever and severe dengue?,"Dengue is a vector-borne disease transmitted by the bite of an infected mosquito. There are 4 serotypes of the virus that causes dengue. These are known as DEN-1, DEN-2, DEN-3, DEN-4.
Severe dengue is a potentially lethal complication which can develop from dengue infections.
It is estimated that there are over 50-100 million cases of dengue worldwide each year and 3 billion people living in dengue endemic countries."
Where does the disease occur?,"Dengue is mainly transmitted by a mosquito (Aedes aegypti) and is distributed across all tropical countries (map available). Ae. aegypti and other species such as Ae. albopictus are highly adaptive and their combined distribution can spread dengue higher up north across Europe or North America during summer. (Note: Travellers already infected with the virus also spread the disease when they get bitten by the local Aedes mosquito population).
Dengue outbreaks can occur anytime, as long as the mosquitoes are still active. However, in general, high humidity and temperature are conditions that favour mosquito survival, increasing the likelihood of transmission."
What are the symptoms of dengue fever and severe dengue?,"Dengue fever
Dengue causes flu-like symptoms and lasts for 2-7 days. Dengue fever usually occurs after an incubation period of 4-10 days after the bite of the infected mosquito.
High Fever (40°C/ 104°F) is usually accompanied by at least two of the following symptoms:

Headaches
Pain behind eyes
Nausea, vomiting
Swollen glands
Joint, bone or muscle pains
Rash

Severe dengue
When developing into severe dengue, the critical phase takes place around 3-7 days after the first sign of illness. Temperature will decrease; this does NOT mean the person is necessarily recovering. On the other hand, special attention needs to be given to these warning signs as it could lead to severe dengue:

Severe abdominal pain
Persistent vomiting
Bleeding gums
Vomiting blood
Rapid breathing
Fatigue/ restlessness

When severe dengue is suspected, the person should be rushed to the emergency room or to the closest health care provider as it causes:

Plasma leaking that may lead to shock and/or fluid accumulation with/without respiratory distress;
Severe bleeding;
Severe organ impairment."
What is the treatment for dengue?,"There is no vaccine or specific medication for dengue fever.
Patients should seek medical advice, rest and drink plenty of fluids. Paracetamol can be taken to bring down fever and reduce joint pains. However, aspirin or ibuprofen should not be taken since they can increase the risk of bleeding.
Patients who are already infected with the dengue virus can transmit the infection via Aedes mosquitoes after the first symptoms appear (during 4-5 days; maximum 12). As a precautionary approach, patients can adopt measures to reduce transmission by sleeping under a treated net especially during the period of illness with fever.
Infection with one strain will provide life-time protection only against that particular strain. However, it is still possible to become infected by other strains and develop into severe dengue.
When warning signs of severe dengue are present (listed above), it is imperative to consult a doctor and seek hospitalization to manage the disease.
With proper medical care and early recognition, case-fatality rates are below 1%. However, the overall experience remains very discomforting and unpleasant."
The right age to begin sexuality education is?,"According to International Technical Guidance on Sexuality Education, there is no magic date to start sexuality education. Even pre-school children can be given developmentally appropriate information e.g. to teach them about their bodies and to shape their thinking about gender equality."
"Contraceptive methods such as pills, injectables, implants and intrauterine devices have negative effects on the health of adolescent girls?","Age does not constitute a medical reason for refusing to provide contraception. In other words, there is no medical reason for withholding the provision of contraceptive methods to adolescents."
Child marriage – in which one or both persons are below the age of 18 – affects:,"Globally it is estimated that 1 in 5 girls below the age of 18 are married or in other forms of union. In some countries however, the proportion of girls married by the age of 18 is higher - 1 in 3."
The Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) vaccine is an effective means of preventing:,"Over time, infection with the Human Papilloma Virus leads to cancer of the cervix. Administration of the HPV vaccine to girls between the ages of 9 and 13 prevents this infection and the subsequent development of cervical cancer."
Who is more likely agree that it is right for a man to beat his wife is she does something wrong?,"In many countries, adolescent girls are more likely to believe that violence is justified than adolescent boys. Further, in many countries, adolescent girls and boys are more likely to justify violence than adult women and men."
What can I do to protect myself and my family?,"If you are living in an area covered by the mass vaccination campaign, ensure that any children under the age of 5 years receive the vaccine, provided for free at health centres, during each vaccination round. All children under 5 years should receive the vaccine, even if they have had it before.

Everyone, whether or not you are covered by the mass vaccination campaign, should ensure children have received three doses of oral polio vaccine (OPV) and one dose of inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) as part of routine childhood immunization.

Proper water, sanitation and hygiene also help to limit the disease’s spread. Wash your hands regularly, use a toilet, cook your food thoroughly and drink safe water. If the safety of your water is in doubt, boil it, ensuring that it has been bubbling vigorously for at least 1 minute before allowing it to cool."
At what age should children in the Philippines receive polio vaccine as part of the routine immunization schedule?,"In the Philippines, oral polio vaccine is routinely given to children at 1 ½, 2 ½, and 3 ½ months, and inactivated polio vaccine at 3 ½ months."
Does polio vaccine have any side effects?,"Polio vaccines are safe, effective and essential protection for all children against polio. Over the last 30 years, oral polio vaccine has saved 18 million people all over the world from permanent paralysis by polio.

Side effects are usually minor. For example, those vaccinated with inactivated polio vaccine may experience pain and redness at the injection site. People sometimes temporarily feel faint after being vaccinated – they should be encouraged to lie down until it passes.

As with any medication, other, more serious side effects (e.g. severe allergic reaction) are possible but rare. Children are in far greater danger from the circulating polioviruses than from any adverse effects from the polio vaccine."
Is polio vaccine halal?,"The Islamic Advisory Group (IAG) for Immunization, a consortium of prestigious Islamic religious organizations, has expressed “trust in the safety of all routine childhood vaccinations as a life-saving tool which protects children and acknowledges that it conforms to Islamic Shariah”.

In 2019, the Ministry of Health – Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao, together with 13 religious leaders, issued a fatwa (Islamic ruling) that promotes immunization to prevent deaths and suffering from vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, tetanus, polio, pneumonia, hepatitis, diphtheria, rubella, and mumps."
Is it safe for children to receive multiple doses of oral polio vaccine?,"Yes, it is safe, and it is essential to administer multiple doses of oral polio vaccine to children. The vaccine is designed to be administered multiple times to ensure full protection. Each additional dose further strengthens a child’s immunity level against polio."
How many doses of oral polio vaccine does a child need before they are protected?,"Children need multiple doses of oral polio vaccine to be fully protected. Until a child is fully immunized, they are still at risk from polio. This is why every child must be immunized during every immunization campaign against polio. Every missed child is a place for the poliovirus to hide."
Should a child receive oral polio vaccine during polio campaigns and through routine immunization?,"Yes. Oral polio vaccine (OPV) is safe and effective. Every extra dose means a child gets additional protection against polio. It takes multiple doses of OPV to achieve full immunity against polio. If a child has received the vaccine before, then extra doses given during immunization campaigns will provide valuable additional protection against polio."
My child is older than 3 ½ months but hasn’t completed the full routine immunization schedule. Should I get them vaccinated now?,"Yes. For full protection, ensure that your child gets three doses of oral polio vaccine and one dose of inactivated polio vaccine. Speak to your local health professional about the timing of each dose."
What should I do if I suspect I have dengue?,"If you suspect you have dengue you need to see a doctor immediately. To diagnose dengue fever, your doctor will:

Evaluate your signs and symptoms;
Test your blood for evidence of a dengue virus;
Review your medical and travel history.

Persons who had travelled to dengue endemic countries during the past two weeks should inform the doctor about it."
Who spreads dengue and severe dengue?,"Dengue is spread through the bite of the female mosquito (Aedes aegypti). The mosquito becomes infected when it takes the blood of a person infected with the virus. After about one week, the mosquito can then transmit the virus while biting a healthy person. The mosquito can fly up to 400 meters looking for water-filled containers to lay their eggs but usually remains close to the human habitation.
Aedes aegypti is a daytime feeder: The peak biting periods are early in the morning and in the evening before dusk.
Dengue cannot be spread directly from person to person. However, a person infected and suffering from dengue fever can infect other mosquitoes. Humans are known to carry the infection from one country to another or from one area to another during the stage when the virus circulates and reproduces in the blood system.
Aedes aegypti has evolved into an intermittent biter and prefers to bite more than one person during the feeding period. This mechanism has made Aedes aegypti a very highly efficient epidemic vector mosquito."
Where do the mosquitoes breed?,"The mosquitoes thrive in areas close to human population (urban areas).
The dengue mosquito lays its eggs in water-filled containers inside the house and surrounding areas of dwellings (this includes non-used bottles, containers, discarded waste, tyres etc… which hold water).
The eggs hatch when in contact with water. Eggs can withstand very dry conditions and survive for months. Female mosquitoes lay dozens of eggs up to 5 times during their lifetime.
Adult mosquitoes “usually” rest indoors in dark areas (closets, under beds, behind curtains). Here it is protected from wind, rain and most predators, which increases its life expectancy and the probability that it will live long enough to pick up a virus from one person and pass it on to the next."
What can be done to reduce the risk of acquiring dengue?,"The best preventive measure for areas infested with Aedes mosquito is to eliminate the mosquitoes’ egg laying sites – called source reduction. Lowering the number of eggs, larvae and pupae will reduce the number of emerging adult mosquitoes and the transmission of the disease. Examples of the following habitats are listed:

Indoor
    
Ant traps
Flower vases and saucers
Water storage tank (domestic drinking water, bathroom, etc…)
Plastic containers
Bottles


Outdoor
    
Discarded bottles and tins
Discarded tyres
Artificial containers
Tree holes, potholes, construction sites
Drums for collecting rainwater
Shells, husks, pods from trees
Leaf axils of various plants
Boats, equipment



Items that collect rainwater or are used to store water should be covered or properly discarded. The remaining essential containers should be emptied and cleaned and scrubbed (to remove eggs) at least once a week. This will avoid the adult mosquitoes to emerge from the egg/ larva/ pupa stage.
In fact, the community participation is the key to dengue prevention. As every household aims to reduce vector density, the transmission rate will decrease or maybe even stop."
Personal and household protection,"Protecting yourself from mosquito bites is most effective by reducing exposed skin to mosquitoes to bite on. Long-sleeved clothing and mosquito repellents (containing DEET, IR3535 or Icaridin) are the most viable options.
Window and door screens, air conditioning reduces the risk of mosquitoes coming into contact with the household members. Mosquito nets (and/or insecticide-treated nets) will also provide additional protection to people sleeping during the day, or protect against other mosquitoes which can bite at night (such as malaria). Household insecticides aerosols, mosquito coils or other insecticide vaporizers maybe also reduce biting activity."
What is the leading cause of death among 15-19 year old girls?,"Pregnancy and childbirth complications are the leading cause of death among 15-19 year old girls globally, followed by self-harm, road injuries, diarrheal diseases, and tuberculosis. To prevent early pregnancy and poor reproductive outcomes among adolescents, WHO recommends the following: reduce marriage before the age of 18 years; reduce pregnancy before the age of 20 years; increase use of contraception by adolescents at risk of unintended pregnancy; reduce coerced sex among adolescents; reduce unsafe abortion among adolescents; and increase use of skilled antenatal, childbirth, and postnatal care among adolescents."
What is guinea worm? Is it a real worm?,"Guinea worm is, in fact, a real worm. It is a large nematode, Dracunculus medinensis, which is ingested through drinking contaminated water.  This worm is the largest of the tissue parasite affecting humans. The adult female, which carries about 3 million embryos, can measure 600 to 800 mm in length and 2 mm in diameter. The parasite migrates through the victim's subcutaneous tissues causing severe pain especially when it occurs in the joints. The worm eventually emerges (from the feet in most of the cases), causing an intensely painful oedema, a blister and an ulcer accompanied by fever, nausea and vomiting."
How does Guinea-worm disease spread?,"Infected persons try to relieve the burning sensation by immersing the infected part of their body in local water sources, usually ponds water. This also induces a contraction of the female worm at the base of the ulcer causing the sudden expulsion of hundreds of thousands of first stage larvae into the water. They move actively in the water, where they can live for a few days.
For further development, these larvae need to be ingested by suitable species of voracious predatory crustacean, Cyclops or water fleas which measure 1–2 mm and widely abundant worldwide. In the cyclops, larvae develop to infective third-stage in 14 days at 26°C.
When a person drinks contaminated water from ponds or shallow open wells, the cyclops is dissolved by the gastric acid of the stomach and the larvae are released and migrate through the intestinal wall. After 100 days, the male and female meet and mate. The male becomes encapsulated and dies in the tissues while the female moves down the muscle planes. After about one year of the infection, the female worm emerges usually from the feet releasing thousands of larvae thus repeating the life cycle."
How can Guinea-worm disease be prevented?,"Several measures should be followed to curtail transmissionof the disease:

Effective surveillance to detect all cases within 24 hours of worm emergence and containment of all cases;
Ensuring access to safe drinking water and converting unsafe sources to safe ones;
The construction of copings around well heads or the installation of boreholes with handpumps. This would prevent not only dracunculiasis but also diarrhoeal diseases.
Regular and systematic filtering of drinking water derived from ponds and shallow unprotected wells or from surface water. Finely-meshed cloth or, better still, a filter made from a 0.15 mm nylon mesh, is all that is needed to filter out the cyclops from the drinking water;
Treatment of unsafe water sources with temephos to kill the cyclops;
Health education and social mobilization to encourage affected communities to adopt healthy drinking water behaviour."
Where is Guinea-worm disease found?,"The epidemiology of the disease is determined largely by the use of open stagnant water sources such as ponds and sometimes shallow or step wells. Man-made ponds are the main source of transmission.
Guinea-worm disease is seasonal, occurring with two broad patterns found in endemic areas of Africa, depending on climatic factors.
In the Sahelian zone, transmission generally occurs in the rainy season (May to August).
In the humid savanna and forest zone, the peak occurs in the dry season (September to January).
However, there are local variations in these patterns. Other risk factors are mobility and infection having occurred the previous year."
Why was the Global vector control response 2017–2030 (GVCR) developed?,"Cognizant of recent major outbreaks of dengue, malaria, chikungunya, yellow fever and Zika virus disease, Member States at the 139th WHO Executive Board meeting in May 2016 requested the Director-General to devise an appropriate response."
What is new about the GVCR?,"The GVCR sets out a new strategy to strengthen vector control worldwide through increased capacity, improved surveillance, better coordination and integrated action."
"If my child has completed the full routine immunization schedule, do they need an additional dose now?","Everyone living in areas covered by the mass immunization campaign should ensure that every child under the age of 5 years receives an additional dose of polio vaccine, free of charge, every time it is offered. Each dose provides additional protection."
Do adults need to be vaccinated against polio?,"Children under five years of age are at most risk. This is why children under five will be provided with the vaccine, free of charge, during the mass immunization campaign. The risk for adults is far lower. If you think you have not been immunized and you are concerned, please speak with your local health care professional.

Adults are advised to ensure that any children under your care are fully vaccinated, wash your hands regularly with soap and water, cook your food thoroughly and drink safe water. If the safety of your water is in doubt, boil it, ensuring that it has been bubbling vigorously for at least 1 minute before allowing it to cool. These actions will help limit the risk of a range of diseases, including polio."
What is the difference between oral polio vaccine and inactivated polio vaccine?,"Inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) consists of inactivated (killed) strains of all three poliovirus types (1, 2 and 3). IPV is given as an injection and must be administered by a trained health worker. IPV causes the body to produce antibodies in the blood to all three types of poliovirus. In the event of infection, these antibodies prevent the spread of the virus to the central nervous system and protect against paralysis. In this way, IPV prevents that person from being paralyzed if exposed to polio, but it does not stop transmission of the virus.

The oral polio vaccine (OPV) consists of live, attenuated (weakened) poliovirus strains of one or two poliovirus types. OPV is given as a drop in the mouth. It can be administered by trained volunteers and does not require a nurse, doctor or midwife for administration. When fully immunized, a person develops “gut immunity” and will no longer transmit the virus type included in the vaccine even if they are exposed (e.g. if they are vaccinated with type 2-containg OPV, they will no longer transmit type 2 virus). Thanks to this gut immunity, OPV is the only effective weapon to stop transmission of the poliovirus when an outbreak is detected. Bivalent OPV protects against poliovirus type 1 and 3, while monovalent OPV 2 protects against type 2."
Why do we need both oral polio vaccine and inactivated polio vaccine?,"Combining inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) and oral polio vaccine (OPV) provides the best form of protection from polio. IPV and OPV each cause a different kind of immune reaction, and together they strengthen your child’s protection. It protects your child and helps protect our community."
A wide range of health care workers can provide various aspects of medical abortion services?,"In addition to non-specialist and specialist doctors, a wide range of health worker cadres – such as auxiliary nurses, auxiliary nurse midwives, nurses, midwives, associate/ advanced associate clinicians, pharmacists and doctors of complementary medicine – can provide various aspects of medical abortion services."
An ultrasound is routinely required for provision of abortion?,"Ultrasound scanning is not routinely required for provision of abortion. A physical examination to assess uterine size, assessment of last menstrual period and recognition of symptoms of pregnancy are usually adequate."
Can unsafe abortions be prevented?,Unsafe abortions can be prevented if done by an individual who has the necessary training and done in an environment conforming to minimal medical standards. The proportion of unsafe abortions are significantly higher in developing countries than developed countries. This includes countries with highly restrictive abortion laws.
Medical abortion can be self-managed by the client herself?,"According to the WHO 2018 guidance on Medical Management of Abortion, when using the combination mifepristone and misoprostol regimen, the medical abortion process can be self-managed for pregnancies up to 12 weeks of gestation, including the ability to take the medications at home, without direct supervision of a health-care provider."
Does polio still exist? Is it curable?,"Polio does still exist, although polio cases have decreased by over 99% since 1988, from an estimated more than 350 000 cases to 22 reported cases in 2017. This reduction is the result of the global effort to eradicate the disease. Today, only 3 countries in the world have never stopped transmission of polio (Pakistan, Afghanistan and Nigeria).Despite the progress achieved since 1988, as long as a single child remains infected with poliovirus, children in all countries are at risk of contracting the disease. The poliovirus can easily be imported into a polio-free country and can spread rapidly amongst unimmunized populations. Failure to eradicate polio could result in as many as 200 000 new cases every year, within 10 years, all over the world.There is no cure for polio, it can only be prevented. Polio vaccine, given multiple times, can protect a child for life."
What is vaccine-derived polio?,"Oral polio vaccine (OPV) contains an attenuated (weakened) vaccine-virus, activating an immune response in the body. When a child is immunized with OPV, the weakened vaccine-virus replicates in the intestine for a limited period, thereby developing immunity by building up antibodies. During this time, the vaccine-virus is also excreted. In areas of inadequate sanitation, this excreted vaccine-virus can spread in the immediate community (and this can offer protection to other children through ‘passive’ immunization), before eventually dying out.On rare occasions, if a population is seriously under-immunized, an excreted vaccine-virus can continue to circulate for an extended period of time. The longer it is allowed to survive, the more genetic changes it undergoes. In very rare instances, the vaccine-virus can genetically change into a form that can paralyse – this is what is known as a circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV).It takes a long time for a cVDPV to occur. Generally, the strain will have been allowed to circulate in an un- or under-immunized population for a period of at least 12 months. Circulating VDPVs occur when routine or supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) are poorly conducted and a population is left susceptible to poliovirus, whether from vaccine-derived or wild poliovirus. Hence, the problem is not with the vaccine itself, but low vaccination coverage. If a population is fully immunized, they will be protected against both vaccine-derived and wild polioviruses.Since 2000, more than 10 billion doses of OPV have been administered to nearly 3 billion children worldwide. As a result, more than 13 million cases of polio have been prevented, and the disease has been reduced by more than 99%. During that time, 24 cVDPV outbreaks occurred in 21 countries, resulting in fewer than 760 VDPV cases.Until 2015, over 90% of cVDPV cases were due to the type 2 component in OPV. With the transmission of wild poliovirus type 2 already successfully interrupted since 1999, in April 2016 a switch was implemented from trivalent OPV to bivalent OPV in routine immunization programmes. The removal of the type 2 component of OPV is associated with significant public health benefits, including a reduction of the risk of cases of cVDPV2.The small risk of cVDPVs pales in significance to the tremendous public health benefits associated with OPV. Every year, hundreds of thousands of cases due to wild polio virus are prevented. Well over 10 million cases have been averted since large-scale administration of OPV began 20 years ago.Circulating VDPVs in the past have been rapidly stopped with 2–3 rounds of high-quality immunization campaigns. The solution is the same for all polio outbreaks: immunize every child several times with the oral vaccine to stop polio transmission, regardless of the origin of the virus."
Is Guinea-worm disease fatal?,"Guinea-worm disease is rarely fatal. Frequently, however, the patient remains sick for several months, mainly because:

The emergence of the worm, sometimes several, is accompanied by painful oedema, intense generalised pruritus, blistering and an ulceration of the area from which the worm emerges.
The migration and emergence of the worms occur in sensitive parts of the body, sometimes the articular spaces can lead to permanent disability.
Ulcers caused by the emergence of the worm invariably develop secondary bacterial infections which exacerbate inflammation and pain resulting in temporary disability ranging from a few weeks to a few months.
Accidental rupture of the worm in the tissue spaces can result in serious allergic reactions.

Temporary disability can leave many patients unable to leave their beds for a month during and after the emergence of the worm. This usually occurs during the peak agricultural activities and when labour is in a great demand."
How was the GVCR developed?,"Development commenced in June 2016 through a fast-tracked and broadly consultative process that was co-led by the WHO Global Malaria Programme, the WHO Department of Control of Neglected Tropical Diseases, and the Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases. The strategic approach was welcomed by Member States at the Seventieth World Health Assembly in May 2017, and a dedicated resolution was adopted (WHA70.16)."
"How were the GVCR goals, milestones and targets generated?","These were aligned with Sustainable Development Goal target 3.3 (1), and were formulated on the basis of a comprehensive review of relevant WHO global and regional strategies, plans, frameworks and resolutions on vector-borne diseases.
 These included:

the Global technical strategy for malaria 2016-2030 as adopted by the Sixty-eighth World Health Assembly in May 2015
the Global strategy for dengue prevention and control 2012-2020
resolution WHA66.12 on Neglected tropical diseases adopted by the Sixty-sixth World Health Assembly in May 2013. 

 Targets were based on background modelling that included projections of vector-borne disease burden and risk over the strategic timeframe in order to develop reasonable and achievable targets. These goals, milestones and targets are not intended to replace or override established disease-specific goals, such as for malaria or dengue."
How will the global targets defined in the GVCR apply to individual countries or regions?,"GVCR provides strategic guidance to all Member States and development partners for sustainable vector surveillance and control. It is anticipated that the milestones and targets outlined in the GVCR will be adapted across regions and at national level based on the local situation (for example, diseases, capacity, interventions, and evidence). Countries will establish their own national or subnational targets in reference to national vector-borne disease strategies. Regional strategies and targets may also be developed."
How will the GVCR be implemented?,"Priority activities have been defined for action at national and regional levels. These will need to be supported through broader activities to be undertaken at global level, including those to be undertaken by the WHO Secretariat as well as other partners such as those involved in research and development of new vector control tools, technologies and approaches."
Are the national priority activities to be implemented only at national level?,"In many countries, there is vast geographical and seasonal variation in vector-borne diseases. While GVCR advocates for reforms in national vector control structures, planning and action are not limited to national level. The GVCR emphasizes the need for locally-adapted action, with many of the priority activities to be implemented at provincial and local levels."
What are the major changes that are expected at national level in line with the GVCR? Are all countries expected to have one integrated vector control department?,The required changes at national level will be determined through a comprehensive national vector control needs assessment. National needs assessments are one of the priority activities identified in the GVCR for immediate implementation. It is anticipated that through these needs assessments countries will identify areas that require restructuring/re-orientation for effective vector control programmes to integrate activities and increase efficiency. WHO is currently developing a framework to inform the development of these national vector control needs assessments.
How does the GVCR differ from what is already defined for integrated vector management?,"Integrated vector management is defined as a rational decision-making process for the optimal use of resources for vector control. The GVCR builds on the integrated vector management approach with renewed focus on human capacity at national and subnational levels, as well as strengthened surveillance, infrastructure and management systems. It includes reorienting relevant government programmes around proactive strategies to control new and emerging threats."
How does the GVCR link with One Health concept?,"One Health recognizes that the health of people is connected to the health of animals and the environment. The goal of One Health is to encourage the collaborative efforts of multiple disciplines – working locally, nationally, and globally – to achieve the best health for people, animals, and our environment. A One Health approach is important because six out of every ten infectious diseases in humans are spread from animals. In many parts of the world, several vector-borne diseases such as dengue and yellow fever have a sylvatic transmission cycle in the forests which sustain the reservoir of the disease."
What is the linkage of the GVCR with the International Health Regulations (2005) (IHR)?,An IHR network of country-level focal points and coordination of expertise will play a vital role in prevention and control of potential outbreaks. Vector surveillance and control will be strengthened at all ports of entry as per IHR requirements. Active leadership along with improved coordination and strengthened human capacity at national and subnational levels in accordance with GVCR will foster productive engagement and collaboration in the shared vision of vector-borne diseases reduction.
What are the implications of the GVCR for research and its funding?,"The GVCR calls for increased basic and applied research and innovation as a foundation for strengthening vector control. This encompasses the establishment and maintenance of appropriate capacity within national vector-borne disease programmes in order to collect and use data to inform implementation. It includes the establishment of a national research agenda appropriate to the needs of the programme to support evidence-based vector control. While it will also advocate for the development of new tools, this does not extend to financing and coordination for product research and development, which is adequately addressed through initiatives such as the Consultative Expert Working Group on Research and Development, as was discussed under agenda item 13.5 of the Seventieth World Health Assembly."
"How many snakebites occur each year, and how many injuries/fatalities result from them?","It is very difficult to determine the number of snakebites that occur worldwide, but the best available evidence suggests that each year as many as 2.7 million people develop a clinical illness following a bite from a venomous snake. In the field of clinical toxinology, which studies snakebite and other illnesses caused by venomous and/or poisonous organisms, the term used for such an injury is “envenoming” (American “envenomation”), and patients suffering the effects of venomous snake bite are said to have been “envenomed”. Of the 2.7 million people envenomed each year, between 81,000 and 138,000 die as a result, and as many as 400 000 of the survivors are left permanently disabled."
What makes snakebite a “neglected tropical disease”?,"There are four primary criteria that define an illness as a neglected tropical disease (NTD), and snakebite envenoming satisfies each of them:

First, there is a significant burden of mortality and morbidity (as detailed in the answer to question 1) – snakebite envenoming is a high-impact disease.
Secondly, a majority of incidents of snakebite occur in the world’s tropical and sub-tropical regions, and it particularly impacts the poor – snakebite is a tropical disease.
Thirdly, snakebite is amenable to treatment, as well as prevention – the impact of snakebite can be mitigated now if we make the effort to do so.
Finally, the overall level of investment in research addressing snakebite, from prevention to diagnosis to treatment and rehabilitation, is exceptionally low in comparison to its impact – snakebite is a neglected disease."
Where in the world do the most bites occur?,"The majority of snakebite envenoming cases occur in tropical and sub-tropical regions of the developing world. As many as 46 000 snakebite deaths happen in India alone; sub-Saharan Africa, tropical Asia, New Guinea, and Central and South America are also snakebite hot spots. Underscoring the fact that snakebite is a disease of the developing world are the incredible statistics from Australasia – although Australia itself is world famous for its diversity of highly venomous organisms, on average only 2 people die from snakebite there each year. In nearby New Guinea, on the other hand, an almost identical snake fauna (with, if anything, a lesser diversity of venomous species) claims more than 1000 lives each year. This is largely due to the differing socioeconomic and development levels of the two countries, and emphasizes the greater impact of snakebite envenoming in poor, less-developed communities."
What is measles?,"Measles is a serious, very infectious disease caused by a virus. It spreads easily from person to person through the air, by breathing, coughing and sneezing. Anyone who hasn’t previously had measles or been vaccinated against it can get the disease."
How is measles transmitted?,"Measles is one of the world’s most contagious diseases. It is spread by coughing and sneezing, close personal contact or direct contact with nasal or throat secretions from an infected person. Measles virus can remain in the air for up to two hours after an infected person leaves an area."
What are measles signs and symptoms?,"If a person gets measles, initial symptoms generally appear between one and two weeks after being exposed to the virus. These symptoms include high fever, runny nose and sneezing, cough, red, watery eyes (conjunctivitis) and white spots inside the mouth. Three to five days after these initial symptoms a red, blotchy, non-blistering rash will start at the hairline and behind the ears, spreading over the face and then down the body. The rash isn’t itchy.
If you suspect that you or your child may have measles, it is critical that you notify your doctor or health provider and avoid crowds and public spaces to stop the spread of measles."
Is there a cure for measles?,"There is no specific antiviral therapy for measles. Supportive medical care can help relieve symptoms and address complications such as bacterial infections. Children who have been diagnosed with severe forms of measles, such as those who have been hospitalized, should be treated with two doses of vitamin A, given 24 hours apart."
Who is at risk of measles?,"Anyone who hasn’t previously had measles or been vaccinated against measles can get the disease. Young children, unvaccinated pregnant women and individuals with existing medical conditions are at highest risk of measles and its complications, including death."
What is echinococcosis ?,"Echinococcosis is a parasitic disease that occurs in two main forms in humans: cystic echinococcosis (also known as hydatidosis) and alveolar echinococcosis, caused by the tapeworms Echinococcus granulosus and Echinococcus multilocularis, respectively.
Dogs, foxes and other carnivores harbour the adult worms in their intestine and evacuate the parasite eggs in their faeces. If the eggs are ingested by humans, they develop into larvae in several organs, mainly the liver and lungs.
Both cystic and alveolar echinococcosis are characterized by asymptomatic incubation periods that can last many years until the parasite larvae evolve and trigger clinical signs.
Both diseases can cause serious morbidity and death."
How is echinococcosis transmitted?,"A number of herbivorous and omnivorous animals act as intermediate hosts of Echinococcus by ingesting parasite eggs in contaminated soil and developing parasitic larval stages in their viscera. Carnivores are definitive hosts of the parasite; they are infected through the consumption of viscera of intermediate hosts that harbour the parasite and also through scavenging infected carcases. Humans are accidental intermediate hosts and are unable to transmit the disease.
Transmission of cystic echinococcosis is principally maintained in a dog–sheep–dog cycle, although several other domestic animals may be involved including goats, swine, horses, cattle, camels and yaks. Transmission of alveolar echinococcosis usually occurs in a wildlife cycle among foxes, other carnivores and small mammals (mostly rodents). Domesticated dogs and cats can also be infected.
For both diseases, humans become infected through the ingestion of soil, water or food (e.g. green vegetables, berries) contaminated with the parasites’ eggs shed in the faeces of the carnivores, and also by hand-to-mouth transfer of eggs after contact with the contaminated fur of a carnivore, most commonly a dog."
What are the signs and symptoms?,"Cystic echinococcosis is characterized by an asymptomatic incubation period that can last many years until the parasite cysts evolve and trigger clinical signs, depending on the location and size of the cysts and the pressure exerted on the surrounding tissues. In cystic echinococcosis, the larval stages of the parasite develop as one or more cysts mainly in the liver and lungs, and less frequently in the bones, kidneys, spleen, muscles, central nervous system and eyes. Abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting commonly occur when cysts invade the liver. If the lung is affected, clinical signs include chronic cough, chest pain and shortness of breath.
Alveolar echinococcosis is characterized by an asymptomatic incubation period of 5–15 years and the slow development of a primary tumour-like lesion which is usually located in the liver. Lesions may also involve other organs such as the spleen, lungs and brain following dissemination of the parasite via the blood and lymphatic system. Clinical signs include weight loss, abdominal pain, general malaise and signs of hepatic failure. If left untreated, alveolar echinococcosis is progressive and fatal."
How is echinococcosis diagnosed?,"Human cystic echinococcosis is diagnosed with imaging tools such as ultrasound or computed tomography, and its laboratory confirmation relies on serological tests.

Diagnosis of alveolar echinococcosis is based on clinical findings and epidemiological data, imaging techniques, histopathology and/or nucleic acid detection, and serology."
How is echinococcosis treated?,"Both cystic echinococcosis and alveolar echinococcosis can be expensive and complicated to treat, sometimes requiring extensive surgery and/or prolonged drug therapy.

Four options exist for the treatment of abdominal cystic echinococcosis: (i) percutaneous treatment of the hydatid cysts with the PAIR (Puncture, Aspiration, Injection, Re-aspiration) technique; (ii) surgery; (iii) anti-parasitic drug treatment; and (iv) expectant management (“watch and wait”). The choice must primarily be based on the ultrasound images of the cyst, following a stage-specific approach, and also on the medical infrastructure and human resources available to treat patients.

Early diagnosis and radical (tumour-like) surgery followed by anti-infective prophylaxis remain the key elements for alveolar echinococcosis. If the lesion is confined, radical surgery offers cure. Unfortunately, in many patients the disease is diagnosed at an advanced stage, and palliative surgery, if carried out without or with incomplete anti-parasitic treatment, frequently results in relapses."
Is it anticipated that Ministries of Health will be able to make cost savings through integration across disease programmes?,"Given the essential strengthening of health workforce and infrastructure that is outlined in GVCR, it is likely that in many countries there will need to be some initial increase in investment with a focus on programme re-orientation and sustainability. However, the boost in technical capacity and essential resources and locally-adaptive vector control implementation will be more efficient to detect and manage any possible increases in cases or pockets of outbreaks. This is likely to lead to more effective use of vector control tools for maximum impact – thereby protecting these investments in the mid- to long-term. Prevention of outbreaks of vector-borne diseases is expected to be highly cost-effective to all countries."
Who is expected to fund implementation of the GVCR?,"GVCR has been formulated with inputs from Member States and other experts, including existing multilateral and bilateral donors. GVCR funding will depend on country capacity to re-orient programmes with a greater level of accountability, improved management and to leverage regional cooperation mechanisms. It is envisaged that the clear recognition of the importance of the GVCR at the World Health Assembly will lead to greater advocacy for and attract more resources in a time-limited manner based on the identified needs and activities."
Who is most impacted by snakebite?,"Like most NTDs, snakebite affects particularly the poorest members of society. Agricultural workers (including working children aged 10–14 years) and people living in poorly constructed homes face the highest risk and often have limited access to education, health care and even footwear. When poor people are bitten, the luxury of modern health care is usually far removed from their reality."
What are the socioeconomic consequences of snakebite?,"The socioeconomic impacts of snakebite for survivors and their families can be dire.
In rural India, where 75% of people live on average monthly household incomes of just 5000 rupees (US$ 78), immediate treatment costs after snakebites of more than 350 000 rupees (US$ 5400) have been reported. The follow-on economic losses, due to loss of income or being forced to sell livestock, homes or land in order to meet additional costs, can be as high as 400 000 rupees (US$ 6215). Elsewhere in the developing world, the story is similar: those lucky enough to survive a venomous snakebite are often financially crippled by the cost of treatment, as well as physically crippled by the effects of the venom. Given that a majority of bite sufferers are among the most productive members of society (young, working age men and women), disablement following snakebite can prevent survivors from earning an income, making them a lifelong financial burden for their family members. In addition, snakebite survivors may suffer disfigurement and post-traumatic stress disorder, which can result in their becoming social pariahs."
Which species of snakes are responsible?,"The snake species implicated in serious snakebite injury vary from region to region, a fact that increases the challenge of mitigating the burden of snakebite worldwide. In India, the “big four” species are the Indian cobra (Naja naja), the Russell’s viper (Daboia russelii), the Indian saw-scaled viper (Echis carinatus) and the Indian krait (Bungarus caeruleus), although other species are also implicated in many life-threatening bites.
Throughout the rest of tropical Asia, a similar cohort of culprits occurs, and cobras (Naja ssp.), kraits (Bungarus ssp.) and Russell’s vipers (where they occur) are responsible for the lion’s share of serious bites.
In Africa, different types of cobras (Naja ssp.), multiple species of saw-scaled/carpet viper (Echis ssp.), and puff adders (Bitis arietans) are major culprits, although in some areas mambas (Dendroaspis ssp.) are also responsible for numerous bites, along with other species of viper (particularly other members of the genus Bitis).
In Central and South America, a range of pit-viper species, particularly lanceheads (genus Bothrops and related genera) and rattlesnakes (genus Crotalus) are responsible for the most bites, although coral snakes (genus Micrurus) are common in some areas and capable of inflicting life-threatening envenomations.
In New Guinea, the taipan (Oxyuranus scutellatus) is responsible for the most bites, followed by the death adders (Acanthophis spp.) – both groups of snakes occur also in parts of Australia, but bites in that country are very rare."
How can snakebite be prevented?,"It is often said that prevention is better than cure, and a majority of snakebite accidents are readily preventable. In many parts of the world where snakebite envenoming is very common, walking barefoot through snake-infested areas is a major cause of snakebite and as many as 80% of all snakebites occur on the legs or feet, below the knee. These could be prevented if people had access to cheap, practical and protective footwear, and were educated to understand the importance of wearing their shoes.
Snakes are typically shy creatures that spend most of their time hiding, and piles of human rubbish and old construction materials make perfect shelter sites. Cleaning up and keeping the grass short in areas in close proximity to dwellings, along pathways, and in places where children play, are measures that can reduce the likelihood of snakebites. Similarly using a light when walking outside at night is essential in areas where some snakes forage after dark. Even the short walk from the house to an outdoor latrine can be fatal if you step on a snake in the dark.
Many homes in areas where snakebite is endemic are constructed in such a way that snakes can gain access. Sealing houses so that snakes cannot enter the dwelling can help to prevent snakebites, but if this is not possible, the simple act of sleeping on a raised platform with a well-tucked in mosquito net can prevent not only mosquito-borne diseases but also snakebites."
What is the appropriate first aid for snakebite?,"Most of the methods currently proposed as first aid for snakebites are either ineffective, dangerous, or delay proper medical treatment. Even methods that have been recommended by medical authorities in one part of the world may not be appropriate for use in other places because of the differences in the types of effects that different snake venoms can have.
Methods such as the use of narrow tourniquets, excision or incision of the wounds or the affected limb, the use of chemicals such as potassium permanganate or the application of heated glass containers to produce suction, can all be dangerous as well as ineffective and should not be used. Other types of first aid, such as the use of the Belgian black stone, are simply ineffective and waste valuable time.
The best approach is to immobilize the bitten person and keep them from moving around at all. The application of pressure at the bite-site via a pressure pad, a compression bandage applied to the bitten limb, or both, may be effective in delaying the onset of systemic effects, but is only recommended for bites from snakes with predominantly neurotoxic venom, and not for those that cause significant local tissue damage.
Place envenomed patients on a makeshift stretcher and transport them to medical care without delay. If possible place them on their side to help protect their airway and breathing."
What effective treatments exist for snakebite?,"Administration of the appropriate antivenom is the most effective treatment for life-threatening snakebite. The best response to antivenom is likely when it is administered as soon as possible following a bite, as many of the effects of snake venom are irreversible, including some neurotoxic, cytotoxic, haemorrhagic and haemotoxic effects.
Snake venoms are also highly variable in their toxic components and effects. This variation exists not only among species but often also within a single species among geographical regions, age and size classes, or between the sexes. As a result, antivenom raised against the venom of one species or population may not be effective in the treatment of envenoming by snakes from other species or even other populations of the same species. There are often barriers that complicate the task of ensuring early access to appropriate antivenom to snakebite victims, including lack of appropriate transport networks in developing countries, lack of unbroken cold chain-based distribution systems that can maintain the integrity of antivenom (which may require refrigeration) in rural and remote areas, and general lack of infrastructure associated with healthcare facilities. Surmounting these challenges is essential to effective control of snakebite envenoming."
What can I do to protect myself and my family from measles?,"Vaccination is the best way to protect yourself and your family from measles. Two doses of measles vaccine are needed to protect against the disease. 
Check your and your family’s vaccination records or talk to your health worker today to make sure you and your loved ones are protected. If you are living in an area covered by the measles vaccination campaign, ensure that you follow immunization guidelines issued by local health authorities regarding priority groups for vaccination. It is safe to have the vaccine more than twice."
What is vaccine safety?,"Vaccination is a simple and effective way to protect people of all ages against harmful diseases before they come into contact with them. Vaccination is also safe. Side effects from a vaccine are usually minor and temporary, such as a sore arm or mild fever. Any licensed vaccine is rigorously tested across multiple phases of trials before it is approved for use, and regularly reassessed once introduced. Scientists also constantly monitor information from several sources for any sign a vaccine may cause health risks, and if there is a concern, they take the appropriate investigative and corrective actions. These vaccine safety monitoring processes ensure that potential risks related to vaccination are kept to the minimum possible level. WHO works to make sure that vaccine safety systems exist everywhere so that anyone who receives a vaccine can have their concerns considered and investigated if needed."
How does a vaccine work?,"To produce protection against a disease, vaccines activate biological reactions in the body. Those reactions vary depending on the type of vaccine and its mode of administration. In addition to developing its protective effect, vaccine reactions may include soreness or a mild fever that resolves in a few days. Severe reactions occur very rarely (less than one in 100 000 doses of vaccines administered) and these generally occur in people with pre-existing diseases. If this risk factor is known beforehand, it is possible to prevent any potential reaction.Proper vaccine storage, handling and administration is also important to ensure that vaccination is safe and effective. This is why WHO recommends that all health care personnel who administer vaccines receive comprehensive training before administering vaccines and are aware of their role in relation to monitoring for rare reactions."
Could there be side effects we don’t know about?,"Some side effects are so rare they can’t be detected even after studying the effects of a vaccine on tens of thousands of people. For that reason, the safety of vaccines continues to be monitored even after they are in routine use. Any reports of possible side effects made by parents and health providers are carefully reviewed and may signal the need for further investigation. In addition, large populations of people who receive vaccines are often studied to identify any possible links between vaccination and rare or serious health conditions. If a problem is suspected, a thorough investigation will take place by health authorities and medical experts. Investigations usually involve more tests of vaccine quality, manufacturing processes, and studies of vaccinated and unvaccinated people who have and have not had reactions."
What can we say to parents who have questions about vaccines?,"It is important to respect parents and acknowledge their need for accurate information to guide the health decisions they make for their children. Babies and children need to get their vaccinations on time, so they get the best possible protection. It is important that health providers invite parents to share their questions and concerns during vaccination consultations and assure them that vaccines are the safest way to protect their children from infectious diseases. Parents can be informed that all vaccines go through lengthy and rigorous testing processes and must pass through many clinical trials before they are approved for use."
What does WHO do to promote safe vaccines?,"The safety of vaccines is closely monitored by WHO, national regulatory agencies and vaccine manufacturers during the vaccine development phase and after vaccines have been registered and are utilized on a large scale.  Possible risks related to vaccines are carefully studied with the help of independent scientists.  A vaccine is registered in countries only if it does provide conclusive protection, if it is manufactured according to the highest standards, and if the risks related to its utilization are very low compared to the benefits.  In addition, WHO provides public information about the known risks of vaccines and how to minimize those risks.  This information is updated as new data or new issues emerge or when improvements are made that can reduce those risks.  For WHO-recommended vaccines, see information sheets."
What are WHO’s accomplishments of the last 20 years?,"The Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety (GACVS) is the independent expert group that has advised WHO for the past 20 years.  It meets twice annually and can be consulted any time a new concern is identified by WHO.  GACVS monitors the safety profile of all vaccines recommended by WHO.  Its recommendations are publicly available on its web site.GACVS also publishes warnings every time a particular risk is identified or, importantly, when false rumours can affect the use of a safe vaccine. False rumours or wrong perceptions can endanger the population by depriving it of the protection vaccines provide.GACVS is the driving force behind Vaccine Safety Net – a platform run by WHO assembling trusted web sites from all parts of the world providing reliable information about vaccines.  Those sites can be recognized because they display a WHO-protected visual identity.  As of 19 September 2019, there are 75 sites from 34 countries participating in this network, offering vaccine safety information in 24 languages."
What is the Attacks on Health Care initiative?,"BackgroundHealth care is under attack. The sanctity of health care, the right to health, and International Humanitarian Law are threatened. Such attacks deprive people of urgently needed care, endanger health care providers, and undermine health systems.In 2012, World Health Assembly Resolution 65.20 was adopted, which requested WHO to provide leadership at the global level in collecting and reporting information on attacks on health care. WHO subsequently created the Attacks on Health Care (AHC) initiative to systematically collect evidence on attacks on health care, to advocate for the end of such attacks, and to promote best practices for protecting health care from attacksGoalThe vision of the initiative is that essential life-saving health services must be provided to emergency-affected populations unhindered by any form of violence or obstruction.Ultimately, WHO seeks to ensure that:health workers everywhere can provide health care in a safe and protected environment;health workers are protected, resilient and equipped with knowledge and resources;parties to conflict understand and uphold their responsibilities under International Humanitarian Law;health care delivery is not disrupted by attacks; andall forms of violence against health care stop.ObjectivesTo achieve this mission, three main objectives and work streams of the initiative have been established:Develop a body of evidence on the nature and extent of attacks on health care;Increase commitment to action through strong advocacy to end attacks;Assess the impact of attacks on health care delivery, and document best practices to prevent and mitigate consequences of attacks."
Why has WHO undertaken the Attacks on Health Care initiative?,"WHA Resolution 65.20 (2012) called on WHO’s Director-General to provide global leadership in the development of methods for systematic collection and dissemination of data on attacks on health facilities, health workers, health transport and patients in complex humanitarian emergencies, in coordination with other relevant United Nations bodies and partners.The initiative was created in response to this resolution with the understanding that data collection needs to be supported by other areas of work, such as strong advocacy and guidance on how to prevent attacks and increase resilience of health systems, in order to adequately address the issue."
What are attacks on health care?,"WHO defines an attack on health care as any act of verbal or physical violence or obstruction or threat of violence that interferes with the availability, access and delivery of curative and/or preventive health services during emergencies.Examples of types of attacks on health can includeViolence with heavy weaponsViolence with individual weaponsObstruction to delivery of carePsychological violence/threat of violence/intimidationMilitarization of health care assetAssault without weaponsChemical agentRemoval of health care assetsArsonSexual assaultArmed or violent searchAbduction/arrest/detention of health workers or patients"
What are the consequences of attacks on health care?,"Attacks not only endanger health care providers; they can also deprive people of urgently needed care. The full extent of the impact of attacks on health care is not yet known. The short-term and more immediate effects are better understood in terms of the facilities or health workers lost, but a more in-depth investigation of the mid- to long-term impact is required. WHO aims to better understand these consequences as defined under the third objective of the initiative- investigating the impact of attacks on health care to the health of the affected populations and health service delivery, availability and accessibility. Furthermore, WHO seeks to document best practices undertaken by health actors to prevent attacks and mitigate the consequences of attacks. These findings will help to generate evidence-based recommendations for health actors to implement at the country level."
What is the difference between Attacks on Health Care dashboard and the Surveillance System for Attacks on Health Care?,"Attacks on Health Care dashboard- Secondary data collectionAt WHO HQ, monitoring of secondary sources on the internet is undertaken daily to capture any potential attacks made against health care. Since not all countries are reporting to the SSA currently, and since the SSA can also fail to capture all attacks, the secondary source data allows for a better understanding of other countries where the SSA is not being used, and to triangulate the SSA data. The secondary data is compiled and analyzed quarterly, with statistics published on the Attacks on Health Care dashboard to the Attacks on Health Care website. Secondary data is not verified by WHO.To access the latest WHO dashboards, please visit the secondary data page.Surveillance System for Attacks on Health Care (SSA)The SSA is a global, standardized monitoring system to collect primary data of attacks on health care. WHO works closely with partners on the ground to gather relevant information which is then reviewed by the WHO country office and published in near-real time to a publically available web site. The SSA is currently being rolled out to emergency affected countries and fragile settings that are priority areas of the WHO Health Emergencies Programme.Surveillance System for Attacks on Health Care (SSA) dashboard"
What can we do to mitigate the impacts of snakebite?,"Reducing the burden of snakebite in the tropical developing world is a massive task, with many complicating factors, some of which have been detailed above.
The first step is securing the requisite resources via commitments from WHO Member States, donors and other funding bodies. Supporting the development of functional health systems and other infrastructure in the worst affected regions will not only help reduce the number of snakebite casualties, but contribute to the capacity to fight the myriad other diseases that afflict these areas.
Education, both about the prevention of snakebite, and about appropriate treatment in the event of an accident, is a crucial piece of the puzzle.
Increased investment in research that can deliver tangible and sustainable solutions is essential, particularly with respect to developing and rolling out better diagnostic tools and therapeutic treatments, and improved control tools and strategies.
As with other NTDs, snakebite is a complex disease with many factors that contribute to its overall impact – mitigating these impacts requires commitment from multiple stakeholders."
What’s the measles situation in the Pacific right now?,"Currently Samoa, Tonga, Fiji and American Samoa have declared and are responding to measles outbreaks. Kiribati has three laboratory confirmed cases of measles, which remain under further investigation. The number of new measles cases in the four countries with declared measles outbreaks – American Samoa, Fiji, Samoa and Tonga - is decreasing and the situation is stabilizing. 
Measles outbreaks in the Pacific occur in the context of a global surge in measles cases. In today’s highly interconnected world, measles  - one of the world’s most contagious diseases - can spread far and fast anywhere where communities are unvaccinated. The Pacific is no exception, with high levels of mobility between and within Pacific Islands.
 WHO is working closely with governments and partners to help bring the outbreaks under control with intensified immunization campaigns targeting those most at risk."
I’m travelling to a country that’s experiencing a measles outbreak. Is it safe?,"If you’re planning to travel abroad, including to countries where measles is spreading, plan ahead and make sure you’re up to date with your vaccinations. If you are unsure of your vaccination status, get a measles booster shot at least 15 days before departure. It is safe to have the vaccine more than twice."
Is the measles vaccine safe?,"The measles vaccine is safe and effective in preventing measles. Vaccines, like any medicine, can have side effects but these are usually minor and temporary, such as a sore arm or mild fever. More serious side effects are possible, but extremely rare. Getting the measles vaccine is much safer than getting measles. The most common side effects of the measles vaccine are:

Minor pain (from the injection) and/or reaction (swelling, redness);
Fever;
Mild rash;

You can help alleviate the pain for your child with paracetamol and warm compress."
Are there any people who should not be vaccinated against measles?,"Most people can be vaccinated against measles without any problems. However, some people should not receive the vaccine. You should tell your vaccine provider if you fall into the following groups: 

you are moderately or severely ill, with or without fever;
you have received any other vaccines in the past four weeks;
you are currently pregnant;
your immune system is severely weakened;
you had a severe allergic reaction after a previous dose of vaccine."

Why does this report include a special focus on the burden of malaria in pregnant women and children?,"Malaria takes a particularly heavy toll on pregnant women and young children.Our analysis shows that, in 2018, an estimated 11 million pregnant women in sub-Saharan Africa were infected with malaria. This resulted in nearly 900 000 children born with a low birth weight. Globally, children account for nearly 70% of malaria-related deaths.The report provides important insight – grounded in strong evidence – into what happens to a pregnant woman and her fetus when the mother is infected with malaria. For example, malaria infection during pregnancy can lead to anaemia in the mother, which can result in complications in pregnancy, premature birth and a low-birth-weight child. Children who are born preterm or with a low birth weight are at a very high risk of dying in their first few weeks of life.Even when a healthy child is born, malaria infection in children can lead to severe malaria and, very often in the highest burden countries, severe malaria anaemia, which also puts the child at greater risk of death."
What are the reasons behind the substantial increase in coverage of preventive malaria therapy seen in 2018 compared to 2017?,"WHO recommends at least 3 doses of intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy (IPTp) for all pregnant women living in malaria-endemic areas of sub-Saharan Africa. In recent years, coverage of the first 2 doses of IPTp has increased steadily, though not at a rapid rate. Notably, this year’s report shows a significant jump of about 10 percentage points in coverage of the third dose of IPTp between 2017 and 2018.The reason is two-fold. The first is that as WHO receives more data from countries, we have been able to analyse the situation more accurately. And the second is that some countries have put significant effort into scaling up this intervention over the last couple of years. Burkina Faso, Tanzania and a few other countries, for example, have reached significant levels of coverage of the third IPTp dose."
What are the remaining barriers to accessing preventive malaria therapy among pregnant women?,"Intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy (IPTp) is delivered through antenatal care clinics (ANC). Whenever a pregnant woman seeks ANC services, she is supposed to receive a dose of IPTp after her first trimester, as long as the doses are administered at monthly intervals.The reasons for barriers are two-fold. First, access to ANC coverage is variable: in some countries it’s very high while in others it’s moderate or even low. Often you will see reasonably high coverage of IPTp during the first visit to an ANC clinic, but lower IPT coverage as ANC visits taper off. As such, the biggest barrier to the scale-up of IPTp is insufficient ANC coverage and/or repeat ANC access.The second barrier is linked to health worker practices and health systems issues. Our analysis shows that about 20% of women who are eligible for IPTp do not receive the drug when they visit an ANC clinic for the first time, either because the health worker does not prescribe it or the drug is not available."
The report shows that investment in malaria basic research and product development has been increasing steadily over the past 3 years. Shouldn’t more research correlate to more gains in the fight against malaria?,"A lot of malaria research is done to provide evidence either on the way we implement malaria interventions, or to allow us to better understand the epidemiology of the disease. Some of this operational and epidemiological research can feed into programmes and have immediate impact.However, investment in the discovery and development of new tools usually takes a long time to bear fruit. Fortunately, there are some promising tools in the pipeline. The first vaccine against malaria, RTS,S, is now being evaluated through a pilot implementation programme. New types of insecticide-treated nets to fight malaria-carrying mosquitoes are also being introduced. Continued investment in the research and development of new tools will be critical to reaching our common goal of a world free of malaria."
How does WHO arrive at its estimates for cases in the World malaria report?,"WHO applies 3 methods for calculating estimates of malaria cases. One method uses routine data from countries without any adjustments; in other words, we use the data “as is”, directly from the country. This approach applies to countries that have a very low number of malaria cases, high-quality surveillance systems, and are near elimination.The second method is for countries outside of sub-Saharan Africa, excluding Botswana, Ethiopia, Namibia and Rwanda, that have a good public health surveillance system but where a large proportion of patients seek care in the private sector or do not seek treatment at all. Here, adjustments for testing rates, reporting and treatment seeking rates are applied to the reported data.The third method applies to most countries in the WHO African Region, where surveillance systems have been historically weak. To come up with a reliable estimate, we measure the relationship between parasite prevalence and case incidence within a specific area."
More and more patients suspected of malaria are being seen and tested in public health facilities. Does this also mean they are getting the right treatment and cure?,"It’s a good question but one without an easy answer. We know that many patients seek care in the public sector. We also know what proportion of those patients are tested for malaria.Although the evidence suggests that most of the patients who seek care for malaria end up receiving an effective artemisinin combination therapy, the actual quality of that treatment – for example, whether patients are given the right number of doses or whether they comply with the dosage regime – is difficult to determine from the data we currently have at our disposal. But we do know that the drugs available in nearly all malaria-endemic countries remain highly efficacious.It’s important to note that, for young children in sub-Saharan Africa showing signs of a fever, access to health care remains far too low. According to country surveys conducted in recent years, 36% of febrile children in the region were not taken for care with a trained medical provider."
Some malaria experts believe we can actually eradicate malaria by 2050. Why don’t the targets of the global malaria strategy include a time-bound goal for achieving a malaria-free world?,"The vision of our global strategy is a malaria-free world. The targets are actually very ambitious: reductions of at least 90% in malaria morbidity and mortality, and the elimination of malaria in at least 35 countries between 2015 and 2030 – that’s an average of at least two countries becoming malaria-free each year. So it’s a highly ambitious strategy.The reason why we don’t have a time-bound goal is that with the current tools and current levels of investment, it’s unlikely we will achieve global eradication by 2030. At the present time, we don’t have an evidence base to show that malaria can be eradicated by 2050 with existing tools, even if very high coverage levels of those tools are achieved in all malaria-endemic settings.According to the recently released executive summary of the WHO Strategic Advisory Group on Malaria Eradication, a successful approach to malaria eradication calls for focused effort in four areas. One of the highest priorities is a renewed research and development agenda. Other priorities include access to affordable, people-centred health services; a reliable, rapid and accurate surveillance and response system; and the development of national and subnational strategies tailored to local conditions."
What does WHO’s strategy on vaccine safety propose for the next 10 years?,"The Blueprint 2.0 will be designed for all countries rather than concentrating on low- and middle-income countries.  It will focus on strengthening the capacities of national regulatory authorities, so the quality and safety of vaccines can be assured locally and closer to patients.  It will also foster the coordination of efforts between immunization programmes, regulatory agencies and their partners and highlight the responsibility of vaccine manufacturers in monitoring vaccine safety.  Coordination will include new mechanisms to ensure that vaccine safety strategies are fully operational and work effectively.  Finally, the strategy will highlight the role of communication and reliable information to dispel false allegations and wrong perceptions to sensitize people on vaccines’ tremendous benefits for individual and public health."
What do we need to achieve the new strategy’s goals?,"The mechanisms to implement the strategy are already in place.  More funding will be mobilised to ensure success.Basically, the new strategy is implemented through the Global Vaccine Safety Initiative (GVSI), a broad network of vaccine safety stakeholders who work jointly to improve vaccine safety in countries and globally.  The network develops new tools and methods, provides training, conducts studies related to current issues in vaccine safety, and promotes trusted communication based on science and objectivity.  The GVSI has demonstrated its value with the first Blueprint and is well equipped to address the challenges of the next decade.  In addition to implementing the strategy, progress will be monitored continuously.  The idea is that an independent group, convened by the GVSI Observatory, will do the monitoring.  That way, WHO and partners will receive regular information and advice from respected scientists, not directly responsible for Blueprint implementation, on how to better prioritize their efforts."
What innovations can we expect in the future in terms of vaccine safety?,"Besides products with fewer untoward reactions, novel ways of administering vaccines are also under development.  These include pre-filled syringes that avoid any risk related to the transfer from a vial to a syringe.  Vaccine administration at the surface of the skin with patches is also at advanced stages of development.  The use of nucleic acid that can teach the body to produce self-protection against a disease is another avenue.There will also be improvements in the way safety is monitored.  Larger and faster international information systems will take advantage of new information technology.  Agile reporting systems will increase the way vaccine safety concerns are notified.  International networks will be able to rapidly join forces and test, through computer-based records, if a possible reaction to a vaccine is found in all places that use the same product.Finally, information about vaccines and vaccine safety will be increasingly accessible and verified.  People will benefit from trusted sources that use rigorous science to explain what is known about vaccine risks and how to minimize them."
What does the summit of 2-3 December 2019 hope to achieve?,"The Summit has two main aims:First, to enhance WHO’s work on vaccine safety.  WHO’s current vaccine safety strategy – called the Global Vaccine Safety Blueprint – was published in 2012.  The Blueprint has made enormous progress improving vaccine safety in low- and middle-income countries in the last eight years.  WHO now wants to look to the future and enhance its work to meet the challenges of the new decade and the sustainable development agenda.  These include the emergence of many new vaccines, a more interconnected world and the explosion of global communication. Second, it will feature the most recent from state-of-the-art vaccine safety science as we transition to the next decade.  We have learned a lot in recent years and scientifically resolved many vaccine safety issues from the 20th and early 21st centuries.  New issues, primarily related to novel vaccines, have also appeared and require continuing research.  Today we have new tools and methods to resolve those questions quicker, more thoroughly and through broader partnerships.  A publication will be produced to inform the global health community about the current situation."
Is all of the data publicly available?,"The SSA publishes a limited number of data points that are collected by WHO to protect the confidentiality of sources and to prevent any further harm to survivors of an attack and affected population. Information such as the date of an attack, type of attack that occurred and affected health resources are publicly available. Furthermore, the SSA website aggregates the global data and allows users to filter the data for tailored analysis."
Who is WHO working with on this initiative?,"WHO is working closely with the Global Health Cluster and Health Clusters in each country where the initiative is rolled out. WHO country offices also engage with non-health partners at the country level who have experience on this issue, such as the Office for United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights.Additionally, WHO works with ICRC’s Health Care in Danger initiative, Safeguarding Health in Conflict Coalition and Médicins Sans Frontières Attacks on medical care program.WHO participates in the Friends of Security Council Resolution 2286 working group in Geneva and regularly briefs Member States on the progress of the initiative."
What advocacy work is WHO doing for the initiative?,"WHO is developing an advocacy strategy which includes a work plan linking action undertaken at the country, regional and global levels.WHO participates in all relevant global-level fora and coordinates regularly with other agencies who are advocating on this issue to highlighting the problem and action to be taken.Communication products are systematically developed and disseminated through various media such as social media, news agencies and our home page."
How can I spot an SF medical product?,"Some falsified medical products are almost visually identical to the genuine product and very difficult to detect. However, many can be identified by following the steps listed below; Examine the packaging for condition, spelling mistakes or grammatical errors.Check the manufacturing and expiry dates, and ensure any details on the outer packaging match the dates shown on the inner packaging.Ensure the medicine looks correct, is not discoloured, degraded or has an unusual smell.If you suspect it is not working properly or have suffered an adverse reaction, discuss with your pharmacist or Doctor as soon as possible."
How can I avoid SF medical products?,"The following steps will help minimise the risk from SF medical products:Source from trusted and licensed outlets, e.g. pharmacies, clinics, doctors, hospitals, health centres.Avoid unregistered websites supplying medical products that conceal their physical address or landline telephone number.Examine the packaging for condition, spelling mistakes or grammatical errors.Check the manufacturing and expiry dates.Ensure the medicine looks correct, is not discoloured, degraded or has an unusual smell.If you suspect it is not working properly or have suffered an adverse reaction, discuss with your pharmacist or Doctor as soon as possible."
What should I do if I think I have an SF medical product?,"You should discuss your suspicion with a pharmacist, Doctor or other healthcare professional. You should also report your suspicion to the National Medicines Regulatory Authority.In cases where you have suffered an adverse reaction to the medicine, including its failure to work properly, you should report this to a healthcare professional immediately."
Are SF medical products available on the internet?,"Unregulated websites supplying medicines, particularly those concealing their physical address or landline telephone number are frequently the source of unlicensed, substandard and falsified medical products. Consumers should be aware of the followingDo not respond to SPAM e mail advertising medicinesLook for a verification logo or certificate and check it out for authenticityLook for spelling mistakes and poor grammarBeware websites that do not display a physical address or landlineBeware websites offering prescription only medicines without a prescriptionBeware suspiciously low priced products or 2 for 1 offersOn receipt of medicines that you have purchased on line consumers should check the followingHave you received exactly the medicine you orderedIs it the correct dosageIs the packaging in good condition, clean, with a patient information leaflet and in the language in which it was advertisedDoes the medicine look, feel and smell as it shouldIf security seals are present are they intact with no sign of tamperingDoes any Customs declaration or postal label declare the contents as medicinesDoes the batch number and expiry date on the primary internal packaging match the batch number and expiry date on the secondary (external) packagingHave you noticed any unusual activity on your credit card since the purchase European UnionUS Food and Drugs AdministrationUS National Association of Boards of Pharmacy"
What is WHO doing to tackle the problem of SF medical products?,"WHO provides the secretariat to the Member State Mechanism to address SF medical products. This is a member states forum who have agreed an 8 point work plan to increase co-operation, collaboration and co-ordination, increase capacity and awareness and encourage surveillance and information sharing to fight SF medical productsWHO has launched a global surveillance and monitoring system to encourage countries to systematically report incidents involving SF medical products. The objective is to provide immediate technical support and coordination in emergencies, but also to establish a validated body of evidence of incidents to identify vulnerabilities and make policy recommendations. WHO have conducted regional and national workshops training regulatory, pharmacovigilance and laboratory specialists from Member States in the use of the system and building capacity in the prevention, detection and response to SF Medical Products. This system has already led to the provision of technical support to member states, access to laboratory testing facilities and issue of international medical product alerts. The system will be rolled out to more member states.WHO will continue to work with member states to develop evidence based policy, strengthen regulatory capacity, improve reporting and vigilance and encourage multi-stakeholder collaboration to tackle SF medical products."
What is the role of the Member State Mechanism?,"The Member State Mechanism is the global forum at which Member States can convene, coordinate, decide and organise activities to address SF medical products.It was established in order to protect public health and promote access to affordable, safe, efficacious and quality medical products, through effective collaboration among Member States and the Secretariat, the prevention and control of substandard and falsified medical products and associated activities."
What does the WHO surveillance and monitoring system do?,"The Global Surveillance and Monitoring System for SF medical products was launched in 2013. It is open to all Member States and the largest procurement agencies have been sensitized in the use of the system. Roll out is continuing and its purpose is two-fold,To provide technical support in emergencies, link incidents between countries and regions, and issue WHO medical product alerts.Accumulate a validated body of evidence to more accurately demonstrate the scope, scale, harm caused by SF medical products and identify the vulnerabilities, weaknesses and trends.It is designed to encourage trained focal points in National Regulatory Agencies and International Procurement Agencies to report incidents involving suspected SF medical products in a systematic and structured way to WHO. These reports permit a fast response to emergencies and the issue of alerts in the most serious cases. It also permits in depth analysis of the medical products most at risk, vulnerabilities and weaknesses in health systems, the harm caused to public health and the need for investment, capacity building and regulatory strengthening. All of which assists in developing evidence based policy."
When do WHO issue medical product rapid alerts?,"The principal objective of a WHO medical product alert is to ensure a timely, proportionate, and consistent response to health events arising from SF medical products which represent a significant threat to International public health.The Surveillance and Monitoring unit within the Safety and Vigilance Team of the Essential Medicines and Health Products Department will take the following criteria into account before issuing a Medical Product Alert:Has the report been validated? Does a genuine and significant risk to public health exist? Does the risk extend beyond the Country where the product was discovered? Have any warnings or alerts concerning the product subject of this incident already been issued, and if so where? Have adequate steps already been taken to remove the product from the supply chain? Is the report recent or is it likely the product remains in circulation?"
"What are substandard, unregistered/unlicensed, and falsified medical products?","Substandard: Also called “out of specification”, these are authorized medical products that fail to meet either their quality standards or specifications, or both.Unregistered/unlicensed: Medical products that have not undergone evaluation and/or approval by the National or Regional Regulatory Authority (NRRA) for the market in which they are marketed/distributed or used, subject to permitted conditions under national or regional regulation and legislation.Falsified: Medical products that deliberately/fraudulently misrepresent their identity, composition or source.Seventieth World Health Assembly update, 29 May 2017Working Definitions Document approved by the Seventieth World Health Assemblypdf, 203kbDefinitions of SF Medical Products"
What is the Attacks on Health Care initiative?,"BackgroundHealth care is under attack. The sanctity of health care, the right to health, and International Humanitarian Law are threatened. Such attacks deprive people of urgently needed care, endanger health care providers, and undermine health systems.In 2012, World Health Assembly Resolution 65.20 was adopted, which requested WHO to provide leadership at the global level in collecting and reporting information on attacks on health care. WHO subsequently created the Attacks on Health Care (AHC) initiative to systematically collect evidence on attacks on health care, to advocate for the end of such attacks, and to promote best practices for protecting health care from attacksGoalThe vision of the initiative is that essential life-saving health services must be provided to emergency-affected populations unhindered by any form of violence or obstruction.Ultimately, WHO seeks to ensure that:health workers everywhere can provide health care in a safe and protected environment;health workers are protected, resilient and equipped with knowledge and resources;parties to conflict understand and uphold their responsibilities under International Humanitarian Law;health care delivery is not disrupted by attacks; andall forms of violence against health care stop.ObjectivesTo achieve this mission, three main objectives and work streams of the initiative have been established:Develop a body of evidence on the nature and extent of attacks on health care;Increase commitment to action through strong advocacy to end attacks;Assess the impact of attacks on health care delivery, and document best practices to prevent and mitigate consequences of attacks."
Why has WHO undertaken the Attacks on Health Care initiative?,"WHA Resolution 65.20 (2012) called on WHO’s Director-General to provide global leadership in the development of methods for systematic collection and dissemination of data on attacks on health facilities, health workers, health transport and patients in complex humanitarian emergencies, in coordination with other relevant United Nations bodies and partners.The initiative was created in response to this resolution with the understanding that data collection needs to be supported by other areas of work, such as strong advocacy and guidance on how to prevent attacks and increase resilience of health systems, in order to adequately address the issue."
What are attacks on health care?,"WHO defines an attack on health care as any act of verbal or physical violence or obstruction or threat of violence that interferes with the availability, access and delivery of curative and/or preventive health services during emergencies.Examples of types of attacks on health can includeViolence with heavy weaponsViolence with individual weaponsObstruction to delivery of carePsychological violence/threat of violence/intimidationMilitarization of health care assetAssault without weaponsChemical agentRemoval of health care assetsArsonSexual assaultArmed or violent searchAbduction/arrest/detention of health workers or patients"
What are the consequences of attacks on health care?,"Attacks not only endanger health care providers; they can also deprive people of urgently needed care. The full extent of the impact of attacks on health care is not yet known. The short-term and more immediate effects are better understood in terms of the facilities or health workers lost, but a more in-depth investigation of the mid- to long-term impact is required. WHO aims to better understand these consequences as defined under the third objective of the initiative- investigating the impact of attacks on health care to the health of the affected populations and health service delivery, availability and accessibility. Furthermore, WHO seeks to document best practices undertaken by health actors to prevent attacks and mitigate the consequences of attacks. These findings will help to generate evidence-based recommendations for health actors to implement at the country level."
What is the difference between Attacks on Health Care dashboard and the Surveillance System for Attacks on Health Care?,"Attacks on Health Care dashboard- Secondary data collectionAt WHO HQ, monitoring of secondary sources on the internet is undertaken daily to capture any potential attacks made against health care. Since not all countries are reporting to the SSA currently, and since the SSA can also fail to capture all attacks, the secondary source data allows for a better understanding of other countries where the SSA is not being used, and to triangulate the SSA data. The secondary data is compiled and analyzed quarterly, with statistics published on the Attacks on Health Care dashboard to the Attacks on Health Care website. Secondary data is not verified by WHO.To access the latest WHO dashboards, please visit the secondary data page.To access the latest WHO dashboards, please visit the secondary data page.Surveillance System for Attacks on Health Care (SSA)The SSA is a global, standardized monitoring system to collect primary data of attacks on health care. WHO works closely with partners on the ground to gather relevant information which is then reviewed by the WHO country office and published in near-real time to a publically available web site. The SSA is currently being rolled out to emergency affected countries and fragile settings that are priority areas of the WHO Health Emergencies Programme.Surveillance System for Attacks on Health Care (SSA) dashboard"
Asthma,"Asthma is a common lung condition that causes sporadic breathing difficulties. It often starts in childhood, although it can also develop in adults, and affects people of all ages. There is currently no cure, but treatment can help control the symptoms. Patients can live full and rewarding lives with the right treatment and management. Asthma is caused by the swelling and narrowing of the tubes that carry air to and from the lungs."
Symptoms,"Breathlessness, coughing and wheezing. The severity and frequency of the symptoms vary from person to person, and for some, become worse during physical activity and at night. Symptoms sometimes get significantly worse. This is commonly known as an asthma attack."
Asthma attacks,"Asthma attacks can be fatal but are largely preventable and manageable. Breathlessness, coughing and wheezing will likely be worse, and the patient may be too breathless to speak, eat or sleep. If a person appears to be having an asthma attack they should sit up straight and take slow, regular breaths, and take regular breaths from their inhaler, as per their treatment plan instructions. If possible, a medical professional should be contacted immediately. Regular checkups and the right treatment will help prevent Asthma attacks."
Treatment and living with asthma,"Asthma is incurable, but manageable. Treatment and vigilance and regular medical checks are crucial. Patients can live rewarding, fulfilling lives with the right treatment. Asthma is often treated using an inhaler to breathe in medicines. People with ongoing symptoms will need to take daily medication for the long-term. It’s also important for people living with asthma to avoid triggers. With medical support, individuals should learn what their own triggers are and take steps to avoid them."
Other complications,"Symptoms can also cause sleeplessness, daytime fatigue, and missing commitments such as school and work."
Causes,"Asthma is caused by the swelling and narrowing of the tubes that carry air to and from the lungs.  The fundamental causes of the disease are likely to be a combination of genetics – for example if your parents have it or it is common in your family – and external triggers, such as:  Allergies to house dust mites, pollen and animal fur. Tobacco smoke, pollution and cold air. Chemical irritants in the workplace such as paint, varnishes and adhesives. Other triggers can include extreme emotional duress, exercise, and for some people, certain medicines."
What do we need to do to get back on track to meet the goals of the Global technical strategy for malaria?,"In the World malaria report 2017, the main message was that the fight against malaria was at a crossroads. The key message for 2018 was that it’s time to get back on track in the global response to the disease.To get back on track, WHO and the RBM Partnership to End Malaria launched the “High burden to high impact” (HBHI) approach in 2018. The new approach essentially recognises the need for stepped-up action across all malaria-endemic countries, and particularly in the 11 countries carrying the highest burden of the disease. Together, these 11 countries account for nearly 70% of the global burden of malaria mortality and morbidity.A number of countries have initiated the HBHI response and are rethinking their strategic planning, interventions and investment based on four response elements. These include galvanising political will to reduce the toll of malaria; better use of strategic information to drive impact; better policy guidance, policies and strategies; and improved coordination of the response within the country – between the ministry of health, the national malaria control programmes and local partners.So, quite clearly, enhanced effort, a smarter way of doing business and better use of the tools at our disposal, including the data, are the best ways to get back on track to meet the goals of our global strategy."
Are drug and insecticide resistance on the rise?,"WHO works with all the malaria-endemic countries to monitor the levels of both drug and insecticide resistance. What we know, at the moment, is that while there is emerging resistance to some antimalarial drugs, particularly in the Greater Mekong Subregion, all current first-line drugs used by all malaria-endemic countries remain highly efficacious.On insecticide resistance, we are seeing increasing levels of resistance to pyrethroids across all malaria-endemic countries. Current evidence suggests that nets treated with pyrethroid insecticides should continue to be used by communities to protect themselves against malaria. However, evidence has also shown that in many areas where mosquitoes have developed resistance to pyrethroids, another type of net treated with a pyrethroid and a synergist (known as a pyrethroid-PBO net) provides improved impact against malaria; the scale-up of such nets is warranted in these areas."
What other threats could affect progress in malaria control?,"In terms of other threats, we are closely monitoring an emerging issue whereby malaria parasites have developed the capacity to evade detection by the most commonly-used rapid diagnostic tests. This is a problem with high prevalence in Eritrea, and we are reviewing data from several other countries in Africa. The immediate threat in moderate-to-high transmission African countries is low – diagnostic tests still remain highly sensitive – but we are looking at the situation closely.The single biggest threat in the fight against malaria, of course, remains funding. While the global community has done an excellent job in ensuring that funding is maintained – the recent replenishment of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria was the single largest replenishment in the Fund’s history, for example – we still see that financing levels for malaria remain relatively flat. Unless we do things better and smarter, we may only be able to sustain the gains already made. In some settings, even maintaining the gains will be a challenge amid massive population growth."
Do WHO investigate those involved in manufacturing SF medical products?,"WHO are not the competent organization to deal with the Criminal Investigation or prosecution of those involved in the manufacture, distribution and supply of SF medical products. It is a National responsibility to conduct criminal investigations. Countries are also able to call upon assistance from INTERPOL and EUROPOL in coordinating International Investigations against SF medical products who both have specialist personnel dealing with falsified medicines.INTERPOL"
Do WHO work with the pharmaceutical industry?,"When WHO are notified of an SF medical product by a Member State we will always ask if the genuine manufacturer (innovator or generic) is known and has been contacted. If requested by a Member State WHO will contact the manufacturer to establish the facts. Samples of the suspect medicine may be sent to the genuine manufacturer for laboratory analysis. Where appropriate WHO will always contact the genuine manufacturer, in addition to a quality control laboratory, if the SF product is imitating a WHO pre-qualified product, or if WHO is considering issuing a global medical products alert."
Do WHO work with INTERPOL and World Customs Organizations?,"Both of these law enforcement organizations carry out operational activity to tackle SF medical products.Whilst WHO does not participate in these operations, it is important to better understand precisely which medical products are being seized and clarify which are unlicensed, substandard or falsified products. It is also necessary to ensure a focus on public health and determining if an immediate and serious risk exists in relation to any seized products. Some of these operations take place at ports of entry and some within the market place.It is also important to validate the information gathered by these organizations and assess more accurately the scope, scale and harm caused by SF medical products, informing post market surveillance in countries and identifying the medical products most at risk.INTERPOL"
Is all of the data publically available?,"The SSA publishes a limited number of data points that are collected by WHO to protect the confidentiality of sources and to prevent any further harm to survivors of an attack and affected population. Information such as the date of an attack, type of attack that occurred and affected health resources are publically available. Furthermore, the SSA website aggregates the global data and allows users to filter the data for tailored analysis."
Does WHO seek to identify the perpetrators of the attacks? Why or why not?,"WHO does not collect nor verify information on perpetrators. WHO does not have the mandate nor the capacity to address the question of perpetrators of attacks. WHO’s objective is not to instigate action in relation to accountability but to increase awareness of the issue by highlighting the extent of the problem, so as to instigate action to prevent attacks from occurring."
Who is WHO working with on this initiative?,"WHO is working closely with the Global Health Cluster and Health Clusters in each country where the initiative is rolled out. WHO country offices also engage with non-health partners at the country level who have experience on this issue, such as the Office for United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights.Additionally, WHO works with ICRC’s Health Care in Danger initiative, Safeguarding Health in Conflict Coalition and Médicins Sans Frontières Attacks on medical care program.WHO participates in the Friends of Security Council Resolution 2286 working group in Geneva and regularly briefs Member States on the progress of the initiative."
What advocacy work is WHO doing for the initiative?,"WHO is developing an advocacy strategy which includes a work plan linking action undertaken at the country, regional and global levels.WHO participates in all relevant global-level fora and coordinates regularly with other agencies who are advocating on this issue to highlighting the problem and action to be taken.Communication products are systematically developed and disseminated through various media such as social media, news agencies and our home page."
Global prevalence,Asthma is the most common chronic disease among children worldwide. Around 235 million people are living with asthma. Over 80% of asthma-related deaths occur in low-and lower-middle income countries. Treatment and effective management of asthma saves lives.
What is yaws?,"Yaws is a poverty-related chronic skin disease that affects mainly children below 15 years of age (with a peak between 6 and 10 years).

Yaws forms part of a group of chronic bacterial infections commonly known as the endemic treponematoses. These diseases are caused by spiral bacteria of the genus Treponema, which also includes endemic syphilis (bejel) and pinta. Yaws is the most common of these three infections.

It is caused by the bacterium - is a Treponema pallidumm subspecies pertenue and transmitted by skin contact. Yaws mainly affects the skin, but can also involve the bone and cartilage. The organism that causes yaws is closely related to the one that causes syphilis. Early detection and treatment can avoid gross disfigurement and disability which occur in about 10% of cases."
Where does yaws occur?,"Yaws occurs in overcrowded communities, with limited access to basic amenities, such as water and sanitation, as well as health care.

Yaws primarily affects children aged under 15 years who live in poor communities in warm, humid and tropical forested areas of Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Pacific islands."
How is yaws diagnosed?,"Traditionally, laboratory-based serological tests such as Treponema pallidum particle agglutination (TPPA) and rapid plasma reagin (RPR) are widely used to diagnose treponemal infections (for example, syphilis and yaws). These tests cannot distinguish yaws from syphilis however, and the interpretation of results from these tests in adults who live in yaws endemic areas needs careful clinical assessment because of syphillis.
Rapid point-of-care tests that can be used in the field are widely available.
However, most of them are treponemal-based and cannot distinguish between past and current infection. Recently dual treponemal and nontreponemal rapid tests have become available, thus simplifying diagnosis in the field. These tests are able to detect both present and past infections to guide treatment of people with active infection.

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) can be used to definitively confirm yaws by detecting the organisms in the skin lesions. It can also be used to monitor azithromycin resistance and this test will be very useful in the last phase of the eradication programme."
How can yaws be treated?,"Yaws is cured with a single oral dose of either of 2 antibiotics – azithromycin or benzathine penicillin.


Azithromycin (single oral dose) at 30 mg/kg (maximum 2 gm) is the preferred choice in the WHO ""Yaws Eradication Strategy"" (the Morges Strategy) because of the ease of administration and logistical consideration in large-scale treatment campaigns.
Benzathine penicillin (single intramuscular dose) at 1.2 million units (adults) and 600 000 units (children). For patients allergic to penicillin and azithromycin, doxycycline 100mg (1 tab) orally, b.d. twice daily for 7 days may be used."
How can yaws be prevented?,There is no vaccine for yaws. Health education and improvement in personal hygiene are essential components to reduce transmission of the disease. Contacts of patients with yaws should receive empiric treatment.
What is the role of WHO in crises?,"The primary objective in an emergency, whether natural or man-made, is to reduce avoidable loss of life and the burden of disease and disability.Every day, hundreds of millions of people face threats to health and livelihoods because local and national systems that support their health and lives are overwhelmed or too weak to withstand crises and extreme events.WHO is committed to working better with Member States and other stakeholders so that suffering and death in crises are minimized and systems are protected and repaired. We want to help national authorities and communities to:Prepare for crises by strengthening their overall capacity to manage all types of crises;Mitigate against the effects of crises by taking measures to reduce the effects of disasters and crises on systems that support good public health;Respond to crises by ensuring effective, efficient and timely action to address public health priorities so that lives are saved and suffering is reduced;Recover from crises by ensuring that the local health system is back to functioning.During crises, humanitarian health partners, led by the Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC) Health Custer under the leadership of WHO will empower humanitarian country teams to better address the health aspects and crises.At all levels of WHO, whether it be in Country Offices, Regional Offices, and headquarters, the WHO network for Emergency Risk Management and Humanitarian Response serves as a convener and conduit. It provides information and services, and mobilizes partners to agree on standards and courses of action."
Where is it possible to find information on WHO in crises?,The easiest way to find information is to consult the web page www.who.int/disasters.The regional office web pages are another important source of information.Regional Office for Africa: (http://www.afro.who.int)Regional Office for the Americas: (http://www.paho.org)Regional Office for South-East Asia: (http://www.searo.who.int)Regional Office for Europe: (http://www.euro.who.int)Regional Office for the Eastern Mediterranean: (http://www.emro.who.int)Regional Office for the Western Pacific: (http://www.wpro.who.int)All of the Regional Office web pages are linked to the Humanitarian Health Action website.
What is the Humanitarian Reform and how does it affect WHO’s work?,"The reform process, started in 2005 with the Humanitarian Response Review, represents a considerable change in the international scene and has vast implications for the work of WHO. The Humanitarian Reform is underpinned by three pillars:Improving the predictability of funding through the Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF);Coordinating effective response through the Cluster Approach, andStrengthening the Humanitarian Coordinator System.The three pillars of humanitarian reform are secured by a foundation of strong and collaborative partnerships.Strengthening commitment to coordination at the field level by all humanitarian partners is another pillar of the humanitarian reform process. The IASC self-assessment of the cluster roll-out brought to the fore that humanitarian coordination operations are very much related to the success of inter-cluster relations and efficient cluster roll-out. The two agendas converge. WHO chairs the IASC Humanitarian Coordinators Training Core Group set up to fill an existing gap and improve the ability of the Emergency Relief Coordinator to propose for HC position individuals whose skills, performance and background meet the expectations of leadership and experience of the IASC."
What is the Health Cluster?,"When emergencies occur, coordination is necessary. No one organization can respond to a health crisis alone. The Global Health Cluster is a platform for organizations to work in partnership to ensure collective action results in more timely, effective and predictable response to health emergencies. WHO is the Cluster Lead Agency.There are over 900 partners at country level of which 56 partners engage strategically at global level. Currently there are 30 Health Clusters/Sectors, of which 2 are regional coordination mechanisms. These Health Clusters are working to meet the health needs of approximately 68 million people worldwide.The Global Health Cluster exists to support Health Clusters countries, and it can make a difference by: providing the right expertise at the right place at the right time; building the capacity of Health Cluster Coordinators; gathering and disseminating sound and relevant information to guide partners’ response; identifying and addressing gaps in technical knowledge and available guidance to ensure the health response follows global best practices and standards; and, promoting and advocating for the importance of humanitarian health action on the global stage, to help ensure that Health Clusters receive the political and financial support they need.The cluster approach was developed by the Inter-Agency Standing Committee as part of the humanitarian reform in 2005, to increase the effectiveness of humanitarian response by building partnerships. Clusters are groups of humanitarian organizations, both UN and non-UN, in each of the main sectors of humanitarian action (e.g. water, health and logistics) with clear responsibilities for coordination. The aim of the cluster approach is to strengthen system-wide preparedness and technical capacity to respond to humanitarian emergencies by ensuring that there is predictable leadership and by enhancing the accountability and transparency of humanitarian response.For more information visit the Health Cluster web site"
What is the impact of the Central Emergency Response Fund on WHO’s work?,"The CERF is a United Nations emergency relief fund officially launched on 9 March 2006 by the Secretary-General. In December 2006, pledges to the CERF totalled US$345 million. The objective of the CERF is to provide urgent and effective humanitarian aid to regions threatened by, or experiencing, a humanitarian crisis, and UN agencies and their partners can access the funds within the crucial first 72 hours of a crisis.The CERF has immediately become an essential funding mechanism of WHO’s emergency work. In 2006, CERF grants represented 24% of the funds channelled through WHO’s Health Action in Crises , i.e. more than $24 million, of which $14 million were for rapid response operations and $10.4 for under-funded emergencies."
Do dead bodies cause epidemics?,"No, dead bodies from natural disasters generally do not cause epidemics. This is because victims of such disasters usually die from trauma, drowning or fire and do not normally harbour organisms which cause epidemics.The exception to this is when deaths have occurred from highly infectious diseases (such as Ebola, Lassa fever, cholera), or when the disaster occurred in an area that is endemic for such highly infectious diseases. In these circumstances, the possibility of disease spreading from dead bodies exists."
What are the health risks for the public?,"Unless the deceased has died from a highly infectious disease, the risk to the public is negligible. However, there is a risk of diarrhoea from drinking water contaminated by faecal material from dead bodies. Routine disinfection of drinking water is sufficient to prevent waterborne illness. (See question 6 for the health risks to those handling dead bodies)."
Can dead bodies contaminate water?,"Yes, they can, as do live bodies. Dead bodies often leak faeces which may contaminate rivers or other water sources, causing a risk of diarrhoeal illness which adequate treatment of water can prevent."
Is spraying bodies with disinfectant or lime powder useful?,"Lime powder does not hasten decomposition and, since dead bodies are generally not an infectious risk to the public, disinfectant is not needed."
Local officials and journalists say there is a risk to the public of disease from dead bodies. Are they correct?,"The risk from dead bodies after disasters due to natural hazards is misunderstood by many professionals and the media. Even local or international health workers are often misinformed and contribute to the spread of unfounded rumours about outbreaks and epidemics. Dead bodies from natural disasters generally do not cause epidemics. The risk of disease from dead bodies is real only in cases where the deceased has died of a highly infectious disease or has died in an area where such infectious disease is endemic. Even then, the risk of disease transmission to a trained body-handler is low (see question 6)"
Is there a risk for those handling dead bodies?,"For people handling dead bodies (rescue workers, mortuary workers, etc.), there is a risk if the deceased are infected with highly infectious disease (such as Ebola, Lassa fever, cholera). The infectious agents responsible for these diseases last for varying periods after death. The internal organs that harbour organisms such as tuberculosis, which can survive for very long periods after a person’s death, are usually handled only by trained personnel during an actual autopsy. This is not part of any procedure described in this manual. Processes to support persons handling the dead should be in place to deal with any psychological impacts arising from their work."
What are the International Health Regulations?,"The International Health Regulations (2005), or IHR (2005), represents a binding international legal agreement involving 196 countries across the globe, including all the Member States of WHO. Their aim is to help the international community prevent and respond to acute public health risks that have the potential to cross borders and threaten people worldwide. The purpose and scope of the IHR (2005) is to prevent, protect against, control and provide a public health response to the international spread of disease in ways that are commensurate with and restricted to public health risks, and which avoid unnecessary interference with international traffic and trade."
How does the IHR Emergency Committee work?,"The Emergency Committee is made up of international experts who provide technical advice to the WHO Director-General in the context of a “public health emergency of international concern” (PHEIC) The Committee provides views on:whether the event constitutes a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC);the Temporary Recommendations that should be taken by the country experiencing an emergency of international concern, or by other countries, to prevent or reduce the international spread of disease and avoid unnecessary interference with international trade and travel; andthe termination of a PHEIC.The Director-General makes the final determination of a PHEIC and Temporary Recommendations to address the situation, based on advice from the Emergency Committee, information provided by the State Parties, scientific experts and an assessment of risk to human health, risk of international spread of disease and of risk of interference with international travel.Under the IHR (2005), Temporary Recommendations automatically expire three months after their issuance. Emergency Committees are therefore reconvened at least every 3 months to review the current epidemiological situation and to review whether the event continues to be a public health emergency of international concern and whether changes need to be made to the Temporary Recommendations. A statement of the Emergency Committee meeting is published on the WHO website after each meeting of the Committee."
What is a public health emergency of international concern?,"A PHEIC is defined in the IHR (2005) as, “an extraordinary event which is determined to constitute a public health risk to other States through the international spread of disease and to potentially require a coordinated international response”. This definition implies a situation that is:serious, sudden, unusual or unexpected;carries implications for public health beyond the affected State’s national border; andmay require immediate international action."
Who are the members of an IHR Emergency Committee?,"Members of an IHR Emergency Committee are drawn from the IHR Experts Roster, established by the Director-General, and, where appropriate, from other WHO expert advisory panels. The IHR Expert Roster is composed of international experts in fields such as disease control, virology, vaccine development or infectious disease epidemiology.Members can be selected on the basis of expertise required for any particular session. At least 1 member of the Emergency Committee should be an expert nominated by a State Party within whose territory the event arises. These States Parties are invited to present their views to the Emergency Committee. The Director-General may also appoint 1 or more technical experts to advise the Committee, on his or her own initiative or at the request of the Committee.Persons who are neither members of the IHR Experts Roster nor other WHO Expert Advisory Panels could be appointed as technical experts to advise the Committee, but not as members of the Committee.The names of members and advisers to an IHR Emergency Committee, their job titles and any other information that could be determined to be a potential conflict of interest are published on WHO’s website."
How are the members of an IHR Emergency Committee chosen?,"Selection of members is based primarily on their technical ability and experience in the relevant fields of expertise. The Director-General aims to ensure that members of the IHR Emergency Committee have the broadest possible geographical representation and reflect diverse knowledge, practical experience and approaches. Achieving gender balance is also a desirable aim.Members of WHO advisory panels and committees do not receive any remuneration from the Organization."
How are people appointed to the expert advisory panels?,"A member of an expert advisory panel is an expert appointed by the DG.An expert advisory panel may be established by the DG in any field, as and when required by the development of the Organization’s programme.Any person possessing qualifications and/or experience relevant and useful to the activities of the Organization in a field covered by an established expert advisory panel may be considered for appointment as a member of that panel – after consultations with the national authorities concerned."
What is chikungunya fever?,"Chikungunya fever is a viral illness that is spread by the bites of infected mosquitoes. Chikungunya fever typically lasts from five to seven days and frequently causes severe and often incapacitating joint pain which sometimes persists for much longer periods. It is rarely life-threatening. There is no specific treatment for the disease but analgesics and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication may be used to reduce the pain and swelling. Aspirin should be avoided.There is no vaccine against this virus, so preventive measures depend entirely on avoiding mosquito bites which occur mainly during the daytime, and eliminating mosquito breeding sites.To avoid mosquito bites:wear clothes that cover as much skin as possible;use mosquito repellents on exposed skin and on clothing in accordance with label instructions;use mosquito nets to protect babies, older and sick people and others who rest during the day. The effectiveness of mosquito nets can be improved by treating them with WHO-recommended insecticides.use mosquito coils and insecticide vaporizers during the daytime.The Aedes mosquitoes that transmit chikungunya virus breed in a wide variety of rain-filled containers which are common around human dwellings and workplaces, such as water storage containers, saucers under potted plants and drinking bowls for domestic animals, as well as discarded tyres and food containers.To reduce mosquito breeding:remove discarded containers from around the house;for containers that are in use, turn them over or empty every 3–4 days to prevent mosquito breeding including any water-filled containers indoors. Alternatively, completely cover them to keep out mosquitoes.Between February and October 2006 alone, more than 1.25 million people in India and south Asia were infected with the chikungunya virus. Other large-scale outbreaks of chikungunya fever have occurred in countries of east and central Africa, and the Indian Ocean countries, including Comoros, Gabon, Madagascar, the Maldives, Mauritius, Mayotte, Reunion (France) and the Seychelles. In September 2007, a chikungunya outbreak following an imported case has been notified in northern Italy. The dramatic resurgence and geographic extension of chikungunya in recent years underlines our vulnerability to emerging infectious diseases spread by insects and emphasizes the importance of sustained control programmes as an essential component of health security."
What is a mass gathering?,"A mass gathering is a planned or spontaneous event where the number of people attending could strain the planning and response resources of the community or country hosting the event. The Olympic Games, The Hajj, and other major sporting, religious, and cultural events are all examples of a mass gathering.Mass gatherings may stretch health systems beyond their capacity; however, these events also present opportunities for long-lasting positive effects such as a stronger public health systems after the event, or residents and visitors that are better informed about how they can protect themselves from certain diseases."
What is WHO’s role in mass gatherings?,"WHO provides advice and technical support to host governments preparing for mass gathering events.The goal is to make large international events as safe as possible from public health risks and to encourage a positive public health legacy from these events. This includes lessons learnt for future mass gathering events and an improved health system in the host country.For example, WHO, PAHO and Public Health England, WHO Collaborating Centre in Mass Gatherings and Global Health Security, have been providing expertise to the government of Brazil on planning for mass gatherings since 2012, including the FIFA World Cup in 2014 and the Rio 2016 Games."
What kind of mass gatherings is WHO working on?,"WHO has provided public health assessments, guidance and advice for a range of cultural, religious and sports mass gatherings.For example, the WHO Office for the European Region provided advice and technical support to WHO Member States that hosted the London 2012 Olympic Games, the 2012 UEFA European Football Championships in Poland and Ukraine and the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russian Federation.WHO has also provided advice and technical support to Saudi Arabia for The Hajj, in particular with respect to Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). The Hajj is the largest annual recurring mass gathering event, which attracts roughly 10 million people from more than 180 countries across the globe."
How does WHO provide support to Member States for mass gatherings?,"To provide advice and technical support to Member States that are hosting mass gatherings, WHO draws on 5 WHO Collaborating Centres for Mass Gatherings and a Virtual Interdisciplinary Advisory Group (VIAG). VIAG is an informal network of mass gathering experts. Their role is to share expertise on public health requirements and best practices with any organization considering hosting a mass gathering event.Activities to support host governments of mass gatherings often include:Prior to the event: all-hazard risk assessment, travel medicine and activities to encourage increased physical activity, cessation of tobacco use and avoidance of excess alcohol.During the event: international monitoring of potential disease spread and risk assessment, emergency medical services and hospitals and plans to manage fan zones.After the event: capture lessons learnt and share expertise with future mass gathering hosts.For example, for the 2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa, WHO and other organizations helped the Department of Health of South Africa to design the reporting and oversight methodology for establishing health operations centres at the national and provincial level."
What governs WHO’s work on mass gatherings?,"WHO’s work on mass gatherings was strengthened by a 2011 decision of the WHO Executive Board and the International Health Regulations (2005).The decision states that the WHO ""Director-General should, where appropriate, work closely with Member States that are planning and conducting mass gatherings to support cooperation and communication between the concerned health authorities in each country, and help Member States strengthen capacities to better utilize the International Health Regulations (2005)"".The International Health Regulations (2005) mandate that, ""WHO works with Member States to develop the necessary policies, measures and instruments for managing the potential public health risks associated with mass gathering events."""
Does WHO have the power to cancel or move mass gatherings?,"The decision to cancel, restrict, modify or proceed with any mass gathering event can only be made based on an event - and country-specific risk assessment conducted by the organizers of the event.WHO may provide advice and technical guidance to host countries on public health risks, but has no decision power to uphold, cancel or postpone mass gatherings hosted by Member States."
The Foundations: partnerships,"The Inter-Agency Standing Committee – Established in June 1992 with the purpose to strengthen humanitarian assistance, the Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC) is a unique inter-agency forum for coordination, policy development and decision-making involving the key UN and non-UN humanitarian partners. Under the leadership of the Emergency Relief Coordinator, the IASC develops humanitarian policies, agrees on a clear division of responsibility for the various aspects of humanitarian assistance, identifies and addresses gaps in response, and advocates for effective application of humanitarian principles. WHO is represented in the IASC by its Director-General.The Global Humanitarian Platform – In July 2006, UN agencies, NGOs, the Red Cross/Red Crescent movement, the IOM, and World Bank agreed to convene a forum (GHP) and bring together the three main families of the humanitarian community. The GHP aims at enhancing effective humanitarian action by maximizing the complementarity of different mandates. The GHP will develop “Principles of Partnership”, which will include diversity, mutual respect, responsibility, and transparency, and support their implementation at country level. The GHD agenda privileges a) accountability to the beneficiary populations, b) the capacity of local actors; c) safety and security of humanitarian staff; and d) situations of transition. The GHP meets annually and a Steering Committee oversees the process and sets the strategic directions."
What is WHO’s role within the humanitarian framework?,"In order to advocate for humanitarian health action in crises, WHO participates in the annual humanitarian segment of the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) which allows for substantial debates with all stakeholders involved in humanitarian assistance and for keeping health high on the political/humanitarian agenda.Also, to bring health action in crises to the forefront of humanitarian action and contribute to inter-agency coordination, WHO works with the UN Department for the Coordination of Humanitarian Action (OCHA), the Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC) and other initiatives and entities as relevant. WHO, as a member of the United Nations Development Group (UNDG), is an active player in processes of joint assessments and planning for recovery and reconstruction conducted by the UN and the World Bank. WHO is also part of the United Nations Executive Committee on Humanitarian Affairs (ECHA) which meets on a monthly basis to ensure health as an important component of humanitarian action.To ensure an adequate representation of health needs in the Consolidated Appeals Process (CAP), WHO provides input on the Consolidated Appeals, Common Humanitarian Action Plans (CHAP) and Flash Appeals."
Which inter-agency mechanisms WHO Emergency Risk Management and Humanitarian Response belongs to?,"WHO participates in the work of IASC Taskforce on Preparedness and Contingency Planning and is part of the Framework Team to review/prioritize countries/situations of concern. WHO participates in the inter-agency process to revise the 2001 IASC Guidelines on Contingency Planning.WHO Emergency Risk Management and Humanitarian Response department (ERM) is part of the Inter-Agency Working Group on Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration (DDR) and drafted the health chapter of the United Nations Integrated Disarmament Demobilization and Reintegration Standards. It can be seen at http://unddr.org/WHO/ERM works with the International Secretariat for Disaster Reduction (ISDR) support the reduction of environmental, human, economic and social losses. WHO aims to mainstream disaster management, incorporating a public health aspect in country resilience to natural hazards and related technological and environmental disasters. WHO also ensures best public health practice in inter-agency disaster assessments and participates in UN Disaster Assessment and Coordination (UNDAC) teams.WHO/ERM is part of the IASC Cluster Working Group on Early Recovery, the UNDG-ECHA Working Group on Transitions and the UNDG Technical Working Group on Somalia. WHO and the IFRC jointly issued a publication entitled Tsunami Relief Impact Assessment and Monitoring.WHO is part of the newly established IASC Task force on Safe Access to Firewood and alternative Energy in Humanitarian Settings.WHO co-chairs the IASC Gender Sub-Working Group. WHO drafted the health chapter of the IASC Gender Handbook for Humanitarian Action Women, Girls, Boys & Men: Different Needs – Equal Opportunities.WHO/ERM is part of the Geographical Information Support Team (GIST), an inter-agency initiative promoting the use of geographical data standards and geographical information systems in support of humanitarian relief operations.WHO/ERM participates in the inter-agency Contact Group on Good Humanitarian Donorship (GHD), a Members States initiative to streamline humanitarian funding.WHO/ERM is part of the IASC Taskforce on HIV/AIDS in emergency settings and promotes the use of the IASC HIV/AIDS Guidelines in Emergency Settings.Human Rights and Humanitarian Action. WHO/ERM is part of the newly established IASC Reference Group on Human Rights and Humanitarian Action. Products developed by this Group include the Human Rights Guidance Note for Humanitarian Coordinators (2006) and Frequently Asked Questions on International Humanitarian, Human Rights and Refugee Law (2004).In order to further protect persons affected by natural disasters, WHO was part of the IASC process which drew up the IASC Operational Guidelines on Human Rights and Natural Disasters. Chapter B.2 provides information about the provision of essential health services.WHO is part of the IASC Information Management Working Group.Mental Health and Psychosocial Support in emergencies. The Inter-Agency Standing Committee Working Group endorsed the IASC Guidelines on Mental Health and Psychosocial Support in Emergencies.[pdf, 806 KB] WHO co-chair this Taskforce.Through the Consultative Group on the Use of Military and Civil Defence Assets (MCDA), HAC is promoting cooperation in countries where resources are scarce."
Does WHO have partnerships with non-UN organizations?,"Outside the UN framework, WHO co-operates with a wide network of humanitarian partners worldwide, the Red Cross and Red Crescent movement, Collaborating Centres, universities and other academic institutions, NGOs and senior public health experts. Other key partners are Inter-Governmental institutions such as the African Union, the Council of Europe and the International Organization of Civil Protection.For instance, In May 2005, IFRC and WHO signed a Joint Letter of Collaboration to further enhance collaboration between Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies and national health authorities.Collaborating centres are scientific or academic institutions which have expertise and facilities in specific aspects of emergency preparedness and response, including training and research to field operations. Their expertise spans disaster reduction, technological emergencies, hospital mitigation, critical incident management, disaster medicine, complex emergencies, emergency communications and information management."
Where does WHO get its funding for crises?,"Emergency Risk Management and Humanitarian Response departments' budget is approved by the World Health Assembly biannually. The budget for the 2008-2009 biennium amounts to USD 218 million, 67% higher than the previous biennium.This budget covers the core work of WHO in humanitarian emergencies and crises across the three levels of the Organization: HQ, Regional Offices, and Country Offices in the following manner:USD 137.9 million at country level;USD 50.9 million at regional level;USD 29.6 million at global level.The sources of funding for the core budget of WHO in the Area of Emergencies and Crises for the period 2008-2009 are:8% assessed contributions from Member States (approximately USD 17 million);92% voluntary contributions (approximately USD 201 million).Voluntary contributions come from different sources:Bilateral contributions from Member States earmarked for specific emergencies;Unearmarked bilateral contributions from Member States;Allocations from the UN Central Emergency Response Fund;Allocations from trust funds and humanitarian pooled funds;Funds from foundations and health partners."
What is the role of WHO in emergencies?,"WHO is committed to saving lives and reducing suffering during times of crisis – whether caused by conflict, disease outbreak or a disaster. WHO’s Health Emergencies Programme is committed to working with Member States and other stakeholders so that suffering and death in crises are minimized and systems are protected and repaired. WHO’s Health Emergencies Programme provides the following services to countries:support of the assessment of country health emergency preparedness and development      of national plans to address critical capacity gaps;development of strategies and capacities to prevent and control high-threat infectious      hazards; andmonitoring of new and ongoing public health events to assess, communicate and      recommend action for public health risks.In addition, WHO will work with countries and partners to:ensure readiness to diminish public health risks in countries with high      vulnerability; andprovide life-saving health services to affected populations in countries with      ongoing emergencies."
How can disaster risk reduction help save lives?,"Emergencies can happen in any country, at any time. When disaster strikes, it can seriously disrupt the functioning of a community and people will depend on help from the outside. But a lot can be done to prevent and reduce the effects of disasters as well as to strengthen the response of communities at risk.Countries with well-developed health systems and a well-trained, well-equipped health workforce in communities are much better prepared for disasters. When a community is well-prepared, many lives can be saved in the first hours after an emergency before external help arrives. The people in the community know local risks and their own needs best.To reduce future risks and human and material losses, WHO helps countries build resilience in health systems by strengthening emergency risk management, an approach which includes measures ranging from prevention to preparedness to response and recovery. Emergency risk management actions include:creating supportive national policies, strategies and allocating resources to manage risks;improving access to quality primary health care before disaster strikes, as well as in response and recovery;training and equipping the health workforce and including them in the planning for all types of emergencies;identifying hazards, vulnerabilities, and capacities to assess risks;promoting risk awareness of emergencies and providing health education (e.g. sanitation and hygiene);providing early warning of emergencies to health providers and communities; andprotecting health facilities from hazards and preparing for emergency health response."
How does WHO work with partners in emergencies?,"The Health Emergencies Programme works with its partners to protect and save people’s lives in all health emergencies. During a crisis, WHO works with the local Ministry of Health and partners to identify where health needs are greatest and to coordinate the efforts of partner organizations to ensure that these areas are covered by both medical supplies and personnel.No organization can act alone in emergencies. WHO regularly collaborates with partner networks to leverage and coordinate the expertise of hundreds of partner agencies:Global Health ClusterEmergency Medical TeamsGlobal Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN)Standby partners"
What is the Health Cluster?,"When emergencies occur, coordination is necessary. No one organization can respond to a health crisis alone. The Global Health Cluster is a platform for more than 900 organizations to work in partnership to ensure collective action results in a more timely, effective and predictable response to health emergencies. WHO is the IASC designated Cluster Lead Agency.The Global Health Cluster exists to support countries by:providing the right expertise at the right place at the right time;building the capacity of Health Cluster Coordinators;gathering and disseminating sound and relevant information to guide partners’ response;identifying and addressing gaps in technical knowledge and available guidance to ensure the health response follows global best practices and standards; and,promoting and advocating for the importance of humanitarian health action on the global stage, to help ensure that political and financial support is secured."
Where does WHO get its funding for emergencies?,"Financing the work of the WHO Health Emergencies Programme includes core financing for baseline staff and activities at the 3 levels of the Programme, financing from the WHO Contingency Fund for Emergencies, and financing for ongoing activities in acute and protracted emergencies through appeals guided by humanitarian response plans.The core budget is the funding WHO uses to implement the normative, technical, and operations-management capacities and activities reflected in the results framework for the Health Emergencies Programme. Funding for the core budget comes from 3 sources:Assessed contributions: The annual quotas paid by Member States to      support the work of the Organization.Core voluntary contributions: Flexible contributions made by Member      States and other donors that the Director-General may allocate at her      discretion and according to need.Earmarked contributions: Voluntary contributions earmarked for the core budget of the WHO Health Emergencies Programme or specific activities within it."
How is WHO’s Health Emergencies Programme monitored?,"On 29 March 2016, the Director-General established the Independent Oversight and Advisory Committee to provide oversight and monitoring of the development and performance of the WHO Health Emergencies Programme, guide the Programme’s activities, and report findings through the Executive Board to the Health Assembly. Reports of the Committee will be shared with the United Nations Secretary-General and the Inter-Agency Standing Committee.These are the main functions of the Independent Oversight and Advisory Committee:Assess the performance of the Programme’s key functions in health emergencies      (including all 5 pillars of the work of the Programme, for example,      including both emergency operations and core services).Determine the appropriateness and adequacy of the Programme’s financing and      resourcing.Provide advice to the Director-General.Review the Programme’s reports on WHO’s actions in health emergencies.Review reports on the state of health security developed by the Director-General      for submission to the World Health Assembly through the Executive Board      and to the United Nations General Assembly.Prepare an annual report on its activities, conclusions, recommendations, and,      where necessary, interim reports, for submission by the Chair of the      Committee to the World Health Assembly through the WHO Executive Board.The Committee consists of 8 members drawn from national governments, nongovernmental organizations, and the UN system, with extensive experience in a broad range of disciplines, including public health, infectious disease, humanitarian crises, public administration, emergency management, community engagement, partnerships and development. Members serve in their personal capacity and will exercise their responsibilities with full regard for the paramount importance of independence.The Committee will regularly meet and engage with the Programme management team to help guide its work. They will also assess and influence the work of the Programme through engagement with member states."
Should workers wear a mask?,"The smell from decaying bodies is unpleasant, but the smell itself is not a health risk in well-ventilated areas, and in such areas wearing a mask is not generally required for health reasons. However, special masks may be required for health and safety purposes in some circumstances, including in the presence of toxic gases, smoke, particles, etc."
What should the authorities do with dead bodies in the short term?,"Dead bodies should be collected and stored, using refrigerated containers where possible, or temporary burial. The simple steps required to help identify all the dead bodies should be taken. Photographs should be taken and descriptive information recorded for each body. Remains should be stored or buried temporarily to allow for the possibility of an expert forensic investigation in the future."
Should mass graves be used to speed up the disposal of dead bodies?,"The rapid mass burial of victims on public health grounds is not justified. Rushing to dispose of bodies without having taken photographs and relevant information from them, and without keeping track of the location of each body, traumatizes families and communities. If these simple steps to identify the greatest possible number of bodies are taken, serious social and legal consequences for families can be avoided. In exceptional circumstances, the use of communal graves as a form of temporary traceable storage and protection of dead bodies is acceptable if properly managed."
How urgent is the collection of dead bodies?,"Body collection is not the most urgent task after a disaster from natural hazards. The priority is to rescue and care for survivors. Nevertheless, bodies should be collected and photographed as soon as possible (and preferably before decomposition has commenced), basic information about the bodies should be collected and recorded, unique body codes allocated, and the bodies should be temporarily stored to protect them and to assist possible identification. The earlier this is done, the greater the number of bodies which will be identified. In the presence of an epidemic of highly infectious disease, collection and proper management of dead bodies by trained personnel is an urgent priority."
What are the minimum steps needed to identify as many dead bodies as possible?,"Identifying dead bodies following disasters can be complex. The minimum steps needed to identify as many dead bodies as possible are set out in the Management of Dead Bodies after Disasters manual. In general terms, identifying a dead body is done by comparing information about the person while alive with information about the dead body. Thus, information about those who are missing or presumed to be dead is needed (a list of the missing, and specific individual information about each missing person). Also, information about the dead body is needed (photographs, preferably taken before decomposition has started, and information about identifying features, clothing and personal effects). To keep track of this information, the body needs to be given a unique code which must be in all the photographs, and on all the information collected; and attached to the body and the body bag, and any burial site, so that its location can be recorded, and the body retrieved at any time. Ideally, forensic experts should be involved, but this is not always possible."
What are the potential mental health issues for the bereaved?,"The overwhelming desire of relatives (from all religions and cultures) is to identify their loved ones. All efforts to identify the bodies will help. Grieving and traditional individual burial (or other means of disposal of the body) are important factors for the personal and communal recovery or healing process. In the case of epidemics, traditional burial rites may not be appropriate because of the health risks involved. The psychological issues arising from this must be taken into consideration."
How should bodies of foreigners be managed?,"Overseas families of visitors killed in a disaster, just like local families, will be hoping their loved one is identified, and the body is returned to them. Proper identification has family, social, economic and diplomatic implications. The simple steps required (allocation of a unique body code, photographs, data from the dead bodies collected and stored) will maximize the number of foreigners identified. Foreign consulates and embassies should be informed, and other relevant agencies (ICRC, Interpol, etc.) should be contacted for assistance."
I am a volunteer: how can I help?,"To be helpful you could promote the proper recovery and management of dead bodies and assist in recording the necessary information. You could also assist with the recovery and disposal of the dead, under the direction of a recognized coordinating authority. However, you would first need to be briefed, advised, trained, equipped and supported for this difficult task. The field manual on Management of Dead Bodies after Disasters should be the framework for your participation."
I represent an NGO: how can I help?,"Providing support for families and collecting information in collaboration with the coordinating authority will best help the surviving relatives. You may also promote proper identification and treatment of the dead, including through dissemination of the field manual on Management of Dead Bodies after Disasters. NGOs should not be asked to manage the dead unless they are trained for this task and work for and under the direct supervision of a legal authority.Management of Dead Bodies after Disasters: A Field Manual for First Responders Second Edition"
I am a health professional: how can I help?,The survivors need you more than the dead. Any professional help in fighting the myth of epidemics caused by dead bodies will be appreciated. Talk about this with your colleagues and representatives of the media referencing the field manual on Management of Dead Bodies after Disasters.
I am a journalist: how can I help?,"If you hear comments or statements regarding the need for mass burial or incineration of bodies to avoid epidemics, challenge them. Promote an understanding of the field manual on Management of Dead Bodies after Disasters, including by referring to it in your reports. If necessary, do not hesitate to consult the appropriate persons at WHO, PAHO, ICRC, IFRC or the local Red Cross/Red Crescent office."
What is Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)?,"Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is a viral respiratory illness caused by a coronavirus (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, or MERS‐CoV) that was first identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that can cause diseases in humans, ranging from the common cold to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)."
What are the symptoms of MERS? How severe is it?,"A typical case of MERS includes fever, cough, and/or shortness of breath. Pneumonia is common, however some people infected with the MERS virus have been reported to be asymptomatic. Gastrointestinal symptoms, including diarrhoea, have also been reported. Severe cases of MERS can include respiratory failure that requires mechanical ventilation and support in an intensive-care unit. Some patients have had organ failure, especially of the kidneys, or septic shock. The virus appears to cause more severe disease in people with weakened immune systems, older people, and people with chronic diseases as diabetes, cancer, and chronic lung disease. The mortality rate for people with the MERS virus is approximately 35% – this may be an overestimate however, as mild cases may be missed by existing surveillance systems."
Is there a vaccine for MERS‐CoV? What is the treatment?,"No vaccine or specific treatment for MERS is currently available, however there are several vaccines for MERS in development. Treatment is supportive and based on a person’s clinical condition."
What are foodborne diseases?,"Foodborne diseases encompass a wide spectrum of illnesses and are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. They are illnesses associated with the ingestion of food contaminated by bacteria, viruses, parasites and chemicals as well as bio-toxins."
What are some examples of foodborne diseases?,"Foodborne diseases can be caused: by micro-organisms (e.g. salmonella, campylobacter, enterohaemorrhagic E. Coli, listeria, cholera); by parasites (e.g. fasciola, echinococcus, taenia solium); by chemical agents and bio-toxins such as: - naturally-occurring toxins (e.g. mycotoxins, which are toxins in fungi), - persistant organic pollutants (i.e. pollutants that accumulate in the environment and human bodies) ; - metals (which accumulate in food e.g. lead, mercury, cadmium); and - unconventional agents (e.g. the agent that caused bovine spongiform encephalopathy - also known as ""mad cow disease"")."
How widespread are foodborne diseases?,"Foodborne diseases are a widespread and growing public health problem, both in developed and developing countries. In 2000 the World Health Assembly recognized that the prevention and control of foodborne diseases is an important public health issue (resolution WHA53.15). While most foodborne diseases are sporadic and often not reported, foodborne disease outbreaks may take on massive proportions. For example, the current Salmonella Saintpaul outbreak in the United States affected 43 out of 50 states in the country. The melamine-contaminated dairy products in China affected over 54,000 children. The WHO Global Burden of Disease: Update 2004 has estimated that 2.16 million children die every year from diarrhoeal diseases as a result of exposure to unsafe water, food, and poor sanitation and hygiene. However the proportion of these deaths that is attributable to eating unsafe food is not currently known. Additionally, diarrhoea is a major cause of malnutrition in infants and young children."
What is the situation regarding foodborne diseases in developed and developing countries?,"In some industrialized countries, the percentage of the population suffering from foodborne diseases each year is estimated to be up to 30%.  While less well documented, developing countries bear the brunt of the problem. People living in developing countries are more likely to be exposed to unhealthy environments through:Poor access to clean water to adequately wash food items Unsafe transportation and/or inadequate storage of foods Insufficient knowledge of safe food processing and handling practices   Compromised immune responses to foodborne infections, particularly in populations where malnutrition and HIV/AIDS are prevalentThis is compounded by poor countries' limited capacity to enforce effective food safety measures, including:Efficient foodborne disease surveillance and monitoring systems Food safety regulations and functioning inspection systemsFood safety education programs and Effective emergency planning and relief. The high prevalence of diarrhoeal diseases in many developing countries, including those caused by parasites, points out the urgent need to prioritize foodborne disease prevention and control in national health and development plans.  The full picture of the impact and costs of foodborne diseases - in industrial just as in developing countries - is to date unknown. Many foodborne disease outbreaks go unrecognized, unreported or uninvestigated and may only be visible if connected to situations that have a major public health or economic impact. In order to fill this current data vacuum, the WHO Department of Food Safety, Zoonoses and Foodborne Diseases (FOS) together with its partners launched the Initiative to Estimate the Global Burden of Foodborne Diseases."
How do foodborne diseases challenge public health security?,"Many recent developments have accelerated the spread of foodborne diseases worldwide: 1) In today’s interconnected and interdependent world, local foodborne disease outbreaks have become a potential threat to the entire globe. 2) Both accidentally and deliberately contaminated food products can affect the health of people in many countries at the same time, as well as causing considerable economic losses from lost production and trade embargoes, and damage to a country's tourist industry.  3) Foodborne diseases are not only spreading faster, they also appear to be emerging more rapidly than ever before1 and are able to circumvent conventional control measures. 4) The growing industrialization of food production catalyses the appearance and spread of new pathogens, as was the case for prions associated with bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) which led to new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) in humans in the United Kingdom during the 1990s. The increasing resistance of pathogens to antibiotics is also a major problem."
What is the recommended food for children in their very early years?,"Breast milk is the best food for the healthy growth and development of infants. Infants should be exclusively breastfed for the first six months of life to achieve optimal growth, development and health. After six months, they should be fed adequate and safe complementary foods while continuing breastfeeding for up to two years or beyond.Complementary foods should be rich in nutrients and given in adequate amounts. At six months, caregivers should introduce foods in small amounts and gradually increase the quantity as the child gets older. Young children should receive a variety of foods including meat, poultry, fish or eggs as often as possible. Infants can eat pureed, mashed and semi-solid foods beginning at 6 months, from 8 months, most infants can eat 'finger' foods, and from 12 months, most children can eat the same types of foods as consumed by the rest of the family. The consistency of foods should be appropriate for the child's age. Complementary foods should be given 2–3 times a day between 6–8 months, increasing to 3–4 times a day between 9–11 months. Between 12–23 months of age, 3–4 meals should be given. Also, depending on the child's appetite, 1–2 nutritious snacks can be offered between meals.In addition to providing an adequate variety, amount and frequency of foods, it is important that caregivers practice responsive feeding. That is, they should feed infants directly and assist older children when they feed themselves; feed slowly and patiently and encourage children to eat, but not force them; and when children refuse to eat, experiment with different combinations of foods. Feeding times are periods of learning and love - they are a time for caregivers to talk to the child, making eye to eye contact.These recommendations are made in the Global Strategy for Infant and Young Child Feeding, which was jointly developed by WHO and UNICEF in 2003.The strategy is a guide for countries to develop policies and implement activities addressing feeding practices and the nutritional status, growth and health of infants and children. It is based both on the evidence that nutrition plays a crucial role in the early months and years of life, and on the importance of appropriate feeding practices in achieving optimal health.Lack of appropriate feeding in early childhood is a major risk factor for ill-health throughout the course of life. The life-long impact may include poor school performance, reduced productivity, impaired intellectual and social development, or chronic diseases.Related linksNutritionThe WHO Child Growth Standards"

Is kind of international assistance needed?,A hasty response that is not based on an impartial evaluation only contributes to the chaos. It is better to wait until genuine needs have been assessed.
What is the aim of the HGE Registry?,"In accordance with the principles of transparency and inclusivity, the HGE Registry aims at making information about the kind of research and development that is happening publicly accessible to all interested stakeholders. Making such information available will also contribute to inform appropriate governance."
Why is there a phased approached?,"The Committee agreed on a phased approach, with an initial focus on clinical applications and subsequent efforts to incorporate relevant basic research on human embryos and germline cells. The Committee agreed to begin piloting the first phase of the HGE Registry and begin to consult with those communities most likely to generate relevant work."
What is the scope of the HGE Registry?,"In a first phase, the HGE Registry will cover both somatic and germline clinical trials. The creation of the HGE Registry that covers any proposed clinical trials involving genome editing tools on human embryos and germline cells does not mean that WHO advocates and endorses such activities. In a statement issued on 26 July 2019, the WHO Director General agreed with the WHO Expert Advisory Committee’s recommendation that it would be irresponsible at this time for anyone to proceed with clinical applications of human germline genome editing.  In a second phase, the HGE Registry will also cover research using genome editing technologies on (i) human embryos and on (ii) germline cells or their progenitors when gametes derived from these will be used to create embryos, even when there is no attempt to initiate/establish a pregnancy."
How does the search filter work?,"The HGE Registry identifies clinical trials using genome editing tools by using a filter specifically developed for this purpose. The search filter includes keywords such as “genome editing”, “gene editing”, “CRISPR”, “ZFN” and “TALEN” and several associated products. This filter of keywords was created by the Registry Working Group, which is a sub-group of the WHO Expert Advisory Committee. Searching the complete database of registered records by keywords remains problematic. Indeed, there are risks of having false positives but also, when clinical trials are not using the identified keywords, of missing relevant clinical trials. The feedback of users is therefore very important to continue to improve the accuracy of the search filter. Please contact us if you have any comment or suggestion on the search filter or if you think that a clinical trial is missing from the list of results. In order to better identify clinical trials using genome editing tools, the filter will be regularly revised."
How to register a trial?,"You cannot register a trial with the WHO Human Genome Editing (HGE) Registry. The HGE Registry is not a clinical trials registry but it is a central database that collects information of clinical trials using human genome editing technologies. The HGE Registry is using the data collected by the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), which gathers the trial registration data sets provided by Primary Registries.To register a trial, you need to submit the details of your trial directly to any one of the Primary Registries in the WHO Registry Network or an ICMJE approved registry.To meet the requirements of the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) you can register your trial with any Primary Registry in the WHO Registry Network or an ICMJE approved registry. To meet WHO requirements for transparency and publication, it is only necessary for your trial to be registered once, in either a Primary Registry in the WHO Registry Network or an ICMJE approved registry.NOTE: Regulatory, legal, ethical, funding and other requirements for oversight and conduct of clinical trials differ from country to country. It is recommended that those responsible for conducting a clinical trial check to make sure they are complying with the specific requirements of each country.For additional information: see ICTRP How to Register a Trial."
Where have cases of MERS been identified?,"MERS has been reported in 27 countries since 2012, with approximately 80% of human cases reported by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.  Cases identified outside the Middle East are people who were infected in the Middle East and travelled to areas outside the Middle East.  On rare occasions, small outbreaks have occurred in areas outside the Middle East. For the latest information on MERS outbreaks please see: WHO Disease Outbreak News"
How do people get infected with the MERS virus?,"The MERS virus is transmitted primarily from infected dromedary camels to people, but transmission from people to people is also possible.From animals to people MERS-CoV is a zoonotic virus, meaning it is transmitted between animals and people.  Scientific evidence suggests that people are infected through unprotected direct or indirect contact with infected dromedary camels. The MERS virus has been identified in dromedary camels in several countries, including Burkina Faso, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, Jordan, Kenya, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Mali, Morocco, Netherlands, Nigeria, Oman, Pakistan, Qatar, Spain (Canary Islands), Somalia, Sudan, Tunisia, and the United Arab Emirates.. There is further evidence suggesting the MERS-CoV is widespread in dromedary camels in the Middle East, Africa and South Asia.It is possible that other animal reservoirs exist, however animals including goats, cows, sheep, water buffalo, swine, and wild birds have been tested for MERS-CoV and the virus has not been found. Between people The MERS virus does not pass easily between people unless there is close unprotected contact, such as the provision of clinical care to an infected patient without strict hygiene measures. Transmission between people has been limited to-date, and has been identified among family members, patients, and health care workers. The majority of reported MERS cases to date have occurred in health care settings."
Can someone be infected with MERS-CoV and not be ill?,"Yes, infection with MERS-CoV can be asymptomatic. Infected people with no symptoms have been identified because they were tested for MERS-CoV during investigations among contacts of people known to be infected with MERS-CoV. The role of asymptomatic infected individuals in transmission is currently unknown and under investigation."
Is it easy to detect people who are infected with MERS-CoV?,"It is not always possible to identify people infected with the MERS virus because early symptoms of the disease are non-specific. For this reason, all health care facilities should have standard infection prevention and control practices in place. It is also important to investigate the travel history of people with respiratory infection to determine if they have recently visited countries with active MERS-CoV circulation or have had contact with dromedary camels."
What should a person do if she/he has contact with a person who has MERS?,"If you have had close contact with someone infected with MERS-CoV within the last 14 days without using the recommended infection control precautions, you should contact a healthcare provider for an evaluation."
"Should people avoid contact with camels or camel products? Is it safe to visit farms, markets, or camel fairs?","As a general precaution, anyone visiting farms, markets, barns, or other places where animals are present should practice general hygiene measures. These include regular hand-washing before and after touching animals, and avoiding contact with sick animals.The consumption of raw or undercooked animal products, including milk and meat, carries a high risk of infection from a variety of organisms. Animal products processed appropriately through cooking or pasteurization are safe for consumption, but should also be handled with care to avoid cross-contamination with uncooked foods. Camel meat and camel milk are nutritious products that can be consumed after pasteurization, cooking, or other heat treatments.Until more is understood about MERS-CoV, people with diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised persons are considered to be at high risk of severe disease from MERS-CoV infection. Especially in the Middle East, this group of people should avoid contact with dromedary camels, consuming raw camel milk or camel urine, as well as eating meat that has not been properly cooked.Camel farm and slaughterhouse workers should practice good personal hygiene, including frequent hand washing, facial protection, and protective clothing (which should be removed after work and washed daily). Workers should also avoid exposing family members to soiled work clothing, shoes, or other items that may have come into contact with camels or camel excretions. Sick animals should never be slaughtered for consumption. People should avoid direct contact with any animal that has been confirmed positive for MERS-CoV infection."
Are health care workers at risk from MERS‐CoV?,"Yes. Transmission of MERS-CoV has occurred in health care facilities in several countries, most notably in Saudi Arabia and the Republic of Korea. It is not always possible to identify patients infected with MERS-CoV early or without testing because symptoms and other clinical features may be non-specific.
For this reason, it is important that health care workers apply standard precautions consistently with all patients.Droplet precautions should be added to standard precautions when providing care to all patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection. Contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for suspected or confirmed cases of MERS. Airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol‐generating procedures.Infection prevention and control during health care for MERS"
Are there travel restrictions due to MERS-CoV?,"WHO does not currently recommend restrictions on travel or trade with regard to MERS-CoV.National authorities may take precautions to raise awareness of MERS-CoV and its symptoms among travellers, however, based on their own local risk assessment.International travel and health"
What is risk communication?,"Risk communication refers to the real-time exchange of information, advice and opinions between experts or officials and people who face a threat (hazard) to their survival, health or economic or social well-being. Its ultimate purpose is that everyone at risk is able to take informed decisions to mitigate the effects of the threat (hazard) such as a disease outbreak and take protective and preventive action.Risk communication uses many communications techniques ranging from media and social media communications to mass communications and stakeholder and community engagement. It requires the understanding of stakeholder perceptions, concerns and beliefs, as well as their knowledge and practices. Effective risk communication must also identify early on and subsequently manage rumours, misinformation and other communications challenges."
Why is risk communication important?,"Risk communication refers to the real-time exchange of information, advice and opinions between experts or officials and people who face a threat (hazard) to their survival, health or economic or social well-being. Its ultimate purpose is that everyone at risk is able to take informed decisions to mitigate the effects of the threat (hazard) such as a disease outbreak and take protective and preventive action.Risk communication uses many communications techniques ranging from media and social media communications to mass communications and stakeholder and community engagement. It requires the understanding of stakeholder perceptions, concerns and beliefs, as well as their knowledge and practices. Effective risk communication must also identify early on and subsequently manage rumours, misinformation and other communications challenges."
How does risk communication work?,"Risk communication only works when there is communication based on trust between those who know (experts), those in charge (authorities) and those affected. Without trust, people are unlikely to follow the advice given. Listening to and understanding peoples’ beliefs, concerns and perceptions is just as important as providing them with facts and advice.Explaining honestly what is known and admitting what is uncertain is essential. The credibility of those giving advice; their expressions of caring and empathy; and identifying with the audience are factors that make risk communication effective."
What help can countries get to improve their capacity to communicate risk during emergencies?,"Countries report that they have made progress in risk communication capacity over recent years. However, as health emergencies become increasingly complex, as witnessed during the recent Ebola outbreak in West Africa and in the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza virus, more help is being requested from WHO and partners.WHO provides global guidance on best practices for risk communication and is supporting countries to build up capacities through establishing the right policy, strategy and plans for risk communication, providing training for key personnel, engaging and training journalists on how to report on health emergencies, and running simulation exercises to test national systems. In emergencies, WHO provides hands on support for response by deploying its Emergency Communications Network to affected countries and regions to work hand-in-hand with national and local authorities."
Do disasters bring out the worst in human behaviour?,"Although isolated cases of antisocial behaviour exist, the majority of people respond spontaneously and generously."
Are the affected populations too shocked and helpless to take responsibility for their own survival?,"On the contrary, many find new strength during an emergency, as evidenced by the thousands of volunteers who spontaneously unite to sift through the rubble in search of victims after an earthquake."
Are disasters random killers?,"Disasters strike hardest at the most vulnerable group, the poor -- especially women, children and the elderly."
Is locating disaster victims in temporary settlements the best alternative?,"It should be the last alternative. Many agencies use funds normally spent for tents to purchase building materials, tools, and other construction-related support in the affected country."
Do things get back to normal in a few days?,The effects of a disaster last a long time. Disaster-affected countries deplete much of their financial and material resources in the immediate post-impact phase. Successful relief programs gear their operations to the fact that international interest wanes as needs and shortages become more pressing.
Do starving people eat anything?,"It is widely held that people who are starving will be very hungry and eat any food that can be supplied. This attitude is inhumane and incorrect. Even if hungry initially, people often do not consume adequate quantities of unvaried and unfamiliar foods for long enough. More importantly, the starving people are often ill and may not have a good appetite. They will therefore languish in an emaciated state or get even sicker.Even someone well-nourished would fail to thrive on the monotonous diets of three or so commodities (e.g. wheat, beans and oil) that is all that is available, month in, month out, to many refugees and displaced people. And this is aside from the micro-nutrient deficiencies that often develop. This misconception starts, in part, from a failure to agree on explict objectives for food assistance -- which should surely be to provide for health, welfare, and a reasonably decent existence and help in attaining and acceptable state of self-reliance and self-respect. Source: Lancet, Vol. 340, Nov 28, 1992"
Should children with diarrhoea should be intensively fed?,"A view from many years ago, and from non-emergency situations, sometimes persists -- namely, that children must be rehydrated (and diarrhoea prevented) before re-feeding. This policy is incorrect and, with severely malnourished children, it can be fatal. Any child with diarrhoea must be fed, if necessary with a liquid diet by nasogastric tube, at the same time as additional fluids are given. Even if the diarrhoea is profuse, some nutrients are absorbed and can start the recovery process. To begin feeding after rehydration will often be too late. Source: Lancet, Vol. 340, Nov 28, 1992"
Do refugees manage with less?,"This misconception dehumanizes the refugee. It implies that, once uprooted, he or she no longer has the basic human rights to food, shelter and care - that these are now offered as charitable acts and that refugees can (or should) make do on much less than non-refugees.In fact they will often need more than their normal food requirement at first if they have become malnourished and sick before arrival at a camp and need rehabilitation; and may suffer exposure from inadequate shelter. If the only food source is provided by camp organizers, these rations have to be adequate in all nutrients. This requires a mixed food basket, including fruits and vegetables. If this cannot be ensured then trading may have to be encouraged if refugees are not to become undernourished and deficient in micro-nutrients. The fact that some foods may be traded, to add variety to the diet, is no grounds for reducing the ration. Source: Lancet, Vol. 340, Nov 28, 1992"
Does trading foods indicate that people do not need all of the rations?,"If the only food source is provided by camp organizers, these rations have to be adequate in all nutrients. This requires a mixed food basket, including fruits and vegetables. If this cannot be ensured then trading may have to be encouraged if refugees are not to become undernourished and deficient in micro-nutrients. The fact that some foods may be traded, to add variety to the diet, is no grounds for reducing the ration. Source: Lancet, Vol. 340, Nov 28, 1992"
Is a standard ration suitable for all populations?,"The recommended per caput calorie output for a refugee population should vary according to demographic composition, nutritional and health status of the population (allowing for an extra ""catch-up"" allowance where people are malnourished), the activity level the intake is intended to support, environmental temperature, and likely wastage in the chain from supply of food in a country to its consumption by individuals.In other words there is a range of requirements for dietary energy, which will depend on the circumstances, and use of a single figure is likely to lead to either deficit or wastage. The figure of 1900 kcal (commonly assumed to be of general application) often underestimates what is needed. Source: Lancet, Vol. 340, Nov 28, 1992"
Does energy adequacy mean nutritional adequacy?,"The diet needs to be adequate in both quantity and quality, meeting requirements for calories, protein, and micro-nutrients. Where refugees are completely dependent on the ration provided -- for example, in the early stages of an emergency or in closed camps, where trading for diversity cannot be ensured -- the ration must be designed to meet the requirements of all nutrients in full.Often, a ration is designed to meet minimum energy requirements and micro-nutrients are left to look after themselves. How micro-nutrient needs are to be met must be made explicit, especially when the ration provided is calculated on the basis of fully meeting energy needs. Foods should be diverse and palatable, and the special needs of weaning children must be met."
Do disasters cause deaths at random?,"Disasters tend to take a higher toll on the most vulnerable geographic areas (high-risk areas), generally those settled by the poorest people.Source: WHO/PAHO Myths and Realities in the Management of Dead Bodies"
Which types of insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) does WHO consider to be ‘new types’?,"Until a few years ago, all WHO-recommended ITNs contained only pyrethroid insecticide as the active ingredient (AI). These nets were assessed for physical and chemical durability over an anticipated lifespan of 3 years and 20 washes based on WHO standard washing procedures; they are referred to as pyrethroid-only long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs). Pyrethroid-only LLINs are the current standard of care across most malaria-endemic countries. All other nets are considered ‘new types’ (see Table 1 under Q&A References). In 2009, the first new type of ITN – PermaNet® 3.0 – received an interim recommendation from the former WHO Pesticide Evaluation Scheme (WHOPES). The net contains a pyrethroid insecticide and the synergist piperonyl butoxide (PBO). The addition of PBO is intended to enhance the killing effect of pyrethroids, particularly in mosquito populations that exhibit metabolic resistance. The public health value of a pyrethroid-PBO net was first demonstrated by Olyset® Plus leading to a conditional policy recommendation that encompasses all WHO prequalified pyrethroid-PBO ITNs. Further studies on the public health value of this and other pyrethroid-PBO nets are underway, with the aim of generating additional evidence to support a full WHO policy recommendation (See question “Are new types of ITNs more expensive than pyrethroid-only LLINs?”). To date, five pyrethroid-PBO products have been prequalified by WHO (Olyset® Plus, PermaNet® 3.0, Veeralin®, Tsara® Boost, and Tsara® Plus).In recent years, other types of new nets treated with 2 AIs have been developed. Interceptor® G2 is a dual AI net treated with the pyrethroid alpha-cypermethrin and the pyrrole insecticide chlorfenapyr; it was prequalified by WHO in January 2018. In March 2019, Royal Guard®, a dual AI net containing the pyrethroid alpha-cypermethrin and the insect growth regulator pyriproxyfen, was added to the list of WHO-prequalified vector control products based on an assessment of a complete product dossier. The listing of both Interceptor® G2 and Royal Guard® in the absence of a specific WHO policy recommendation was an exception made during the transition from WHOPES to the new WHO evaluation process for vector control interventions."
Why do WHO guidelines use both the terms long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) and insecticide-treated nets (ITNs)?,"With the arrival of new types of nets, the term ITN was re-introduced by the Global Malaria Programme as the umbrella term for all nets treated with an insecticide, insect-growth regulator and/or synergist. The term LLIN is only being used for ITN classes for which physical and chemical durability have been comprehensively demonstrated against the WHO thresholds of 20 washes and 3 years of use in the field. In practice, this means that only nets treated with a pyrethroid insecticide alone are presently referred to as LLINs in the WHO  Guidelines for malaria vector control and companion documents."
How do these new types of ITNs differ from the traditional pyrethroid-only LLINs?,"Pyrethroid-PBO ITNs differ from pyrethoid-only LLINs in that they contain the synergist piperonyl butoxide (PBO). PBO, by inhibiting certain metabolic enzymes (e.g. mixed-function oxidases, or MFOs), is intended to enhance the killing of the pyrethroid-resistant mosquito population.Pyrethroid-PBO nets kill susceptible mosquitoes in the same way as pyrethroid-only LLINs, while also overcoming individual pyrethroid resistance. This enhanced action can be expected to diminish over time due to ongoing selection pressure on the mosquito population. In the meantime, these types of nets are a useful intervention to deploy in areas of pyrethroid resistance.The dual active ingredient (AI) nets prequalified by WHO, namely Interceptor® G2 and Royal Guard®, contain pyrethroids and additional chemicals that kill or sterilize mosquitoes in ways that are different from pyrethroids. Both nets are intended to perform better than pyrethroid-only LLINs by killing mosquitoes that carry pyrethroid resistance genes, provided these mosquitoes are susceptible to pyrrole insecticides or to pyriproxyfen. Field studies demonstrating improved impact in reducing or preventing Plasmodium infection and/or malaria disease in humans in areas of pyrethroid resistance are presently not available for these 2 products, nor are there conclusive data on the susceptibility of the local mosquito populations in malaria endemic areas to chlorfenapyr or pyriproxyfen."
Are new types of ITNs more effective than pyrethroid-only LLINs?,"According to available entomological evidence, new types of nets may be more effective at killing or controlling pyrethroid-resistant mosquitoes. Currently, WHO evaluation criteria guide the assessments of the entomological efficacy of ITNs against relevant mosquito strains.The WHO prequalification team for vector control sets the baseline for quality, safety, and efficacy of all products that are prequalified. WHO considers that all types of prequalified new nets will perform at least as well as pyrethroid-only nets prior to field use and degradation due to washing and other wear and tear. WHO is, however, presently not in a position to provide guidance on these products’ potentially superior entomological performance or their chemical and physical durability in the field.With respect to improved malaria control, this has only been demonstrated, to date, for one pyrethroid-PBO net – Olyset® Plus – in one  cluster randomized trial conducted in Tanzania. A second study to demonstrate impact in controlling malaria, deploying two pyrethroid-PBO products – Olyset® Plus and PermaNet® 3.0 – is currently underway in Uganda; results will likely be made available for WHO review in 2020. For Interceptor® G2 and Royal Guard®, trials designed to measure epidemiological impact began in 2019, but data to inform potential WHO policy recommendations will not be available until 2022. A trial with Olyset Duo®, a product similar to Royal Guard®, recently ended in Burkina Faso and showed modestly improved malaria control compared to pyrethroid-only nets.In summary, current evidence indicates that pyrethroid-PBO nets are likely to provide better malaria control than pyrethroid-only LLINs in areas of pyrethroid resistance. The extent to which this effect can be achieved by all pyrethroid-PBO nets is unclear, as no comparative performance data for the different products are available. For Interceptor® G2 and Royal Guard®, it is presently unknown whether their deployment will translate into better impact against malaria than that achieved by pyrethroid-only LLINs, or how their impact compares to pyrethroid-PBO ITNs. However, these dual AI nets do provide a new mode of action, which is desirable for pyrethroid resistance management (see question ""When should a country consider purchasing a new type of ITN?"")."
Are all pyrethroid-PBO nets the same?,"No. The products may differ in terms of their chemical and physical specifications (see Table 1 under Q&A References for overview), regeneration times, and wash resistance. Also, there are key differences in product design with respect to the location of the synergist piperonyl butoxide (PBO) on the net (i.e. all net panels or just the top panel); the PBO loading dose (concentration); and the specific pyrethroid (e.g., alphacypermethrin, deltamethrin, and its concentration). It is unknown whether or how these differences translate into potentially different entomological efficacy over time, or epidemiological impact. A study design to test similar performance of products side-by-side – known as a ‘non-inferiority’ study – is being conducted to investigate whether this method may provide a pragmatic approach to investigate these potential differences, and to provide assurance that a policy recommendation based on epidemiological data for one product is applicable to similar products that are considered to be part of the same intervention class. Non-inferiority data on currently WHO prequalified pyrethroid-PBO nets will be available by the end of 2020."
What is a clinical trial,"For the purposes of registration, a clinical trial is any research
 study that prospectively assigns human participants or groups of humans
 to one or more health-related interventions to evaluate the effects on 
health outcomes. Clinical trials may also be referred to as 
interventional trials. Interventions include but are not restricted to 
drugs, cells and other biological products, surgical procedures, 
radiologic procedures, devices, behavioural treatments, process-of-care 
changes, preventive care, etc. This definition includes Phase I to Phase IV trials."
Which trials should be registered?,"All clinical trials meeting the above definition should be 
registered. Thus, early and late trials, trials of marketed or 
non-marketed products, randomized or non-randomized trials -- all should
 be registered."
What is the difference between a clinical trials register and a clinical trials registry?,"A clinical trials register is the formal record of an 
internationally agreed minimum amount of information about a clinical 
trial. This record is usually stored in and managed using a database. A 
clinical trials registry is the entity that houses the register, and is 
responsible for ensuring the completeness and accuracy of the 
information it contains, and that the registered information is used to 
inform health care decision making. A clinical trials registry is more 
than its database."
Why register clinical trials?,"Why is Trial Registration Important?The registration of all interventional trials is considered to be a scientific, ethical and moral responsibility because:There is a need to ensure that decisions about health care are informed by all of the available evidenceIt is difficult to make informed decisions if publication bias and selective reporting are presentThe Declaration of Helsinki
 states that ""Every clinical trial must be registered in a publicly 
accessible database before recruitment of the first subject"".Improving awareness of similar or identical trials will make it 
possible for researchers and funding agencies to avoid unnecessary 
duplicationDescribing clinical trials in progress can make it easier to identify gaps in clinical trials researchMaking researchers and potential participants aware of recruiting trials may facilitate recruitmentEnabling researchers and health care practitioners to identify 
trials in which they may have an interest could result in more effective
 collaboration among researchers. The type of collaboration may include prospective meta-analysisRegistries checking data as part of the registration process may 
lead to improvements in the quality of clinical trials by making it 
possible to identify potential problems (such as problematic 
randomization methods) early in the research process  How to Register a TrialYou cannot register a trial with WHO. The WHO ICTRP is not a clinical trials registry.To register a trial, submit the details directly to any one of the Primary Registries in the WHO Registry Network or an  ICMJE approved registry.To meet the requirements of the International Committee of 
Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) you can register your trial with any 
Primary Registry in the WHO Registry Network or an ICMJE approved 
registry.To meet WHO requirements for transparency and publication, it 
is only necessary for your trial to be registered once, in either a 
Primary Registry in the WHO Registry Network or an ICMJE approved 
registry.NOTE: Regulatory, legal, ethical, funding and other 
requirements for oversight and conduct of clinical trials differ from 
country to country. It is recommended that those responsible for 
conducting a clinical trial check to make sure they are complying with 
the specific requirements of each country.  Organizations with PoliciesThe organizations listed below have policies on clinical trial

Is it best to limit information on the magnitude of the tragedy?,"Restricting access to information creates a lack of confidence in the population, which can lead to misconduct and even violence.Source: WHO/PAHO Myths and Realities in the Management of Dead Bodies"
Are new types of ITNs more expensive than pyrethroid-only LLINs?,"All new types of ITNs currently cost more than a pyrethroid-only LLIN. Specific costs will depend on the size of the net, quantities purchased, lead times and other variables."
"In the context of new types of ITNs, what is the difference between a net being prequalified by WHO and a net having an associated specific WHO policy recommendation?","The WHO prequalification process assesses vector control products for their safety, quality and entomological efficacy against published evaluation standards. Currently prequalified new types of ITNs have demonstrated that they are safe and effective for their intended use. Questions on long-term durability remain, particularly with regards to the wash-resistance of the  synergist piperonyl butoxide (PBO) and of chlorfenapyr and pyriproxyfen. The WHO prequalification team for vector control have initiated a review of these products to address these questions.WHO policy recommendations, in turn, are developed based on the WHO guideline development  process, which requires evidence on the impact of an intervention in reducing the targeted disease(s). Given that ITNs with active ingredients other than pyrethroids have been designed to provide improved disease control in areas where malaria vectors have become insecticide resistant, the development of a policy recommendation for these new products requires demonstration of their public health value by means of at least two trials with epidemiological endpoints. In 2017, WHO granted – on an exceptional basis – a conditional policy recommendation for pyrethroid-PBO ITNs. The recommendation was developed based on  findings from one trial in Tanzania and will remain conditional until data from at least one more trial conducted over 2 years have confirmed the enhanced impact on malaria that was demonstrated in the first study."
Interceptor® G2 and Royal Guard® are not covered by a specific WHO policy recommendation – what does this mean in practice?,"Interceptor® G2 and Royal Guard® were added, on an exceptional basis, to the list of WHO-prequalified vector control products during the WHO transition from the WHO Pesticide Evaluation Scheme to the new WHO evaluation process for vector control
    interventions. While both nets meet WHO standards for safety, there are no available epidemiological data to indicate whether Interceptor® G2 and Royal Guard® would control malaria better than a pyrethroid-only LLIN. For lack of a better alternative, both products are considered as covered by
    the WHO policy recommendation for pyrethroid-only nets. As soon as data on the epidemiological impact of these two products have been generated and reviewed by WHO’s Vector Control Advisory Group (VCAG), WHO will formulate specific policy recommendations.Meanwhile, WHO recognizes that some Member States may be interested in deploying new types of ITNs not covered by specific policy recommendations. Guidance for such countries is included in the question ""When should a country consider purchasing a new type of ITN?"""
When should a country consider purchasing a new type of ITN?,"WHO released conditional recommendations on deployment of pyrethroid-PBO nets in 2017, including guidance on the characteristics of settings
    most likely to benefit from deployment of pyrethroid-PBO nets. Over the last 2 years, WHO has worked with partners in translating these recommendations into the practical deployment of pyrethroid-PBO nets. This experience has shown that data on specific contextual characteristics – particularly data on involvement of monooxygenases – are often not available at county or province level and that countries are forced to extrapolate from existing
    data points. To support pragmatic decision-making, WHO has developed a simplified overview of areas where deployment of pyrethroid-PBO nets may be most beneficial, based on current available evidence (See figure 10.2 of the World malaria report 2019). Given
 the resource constraints of national malaria programmes and supply constraints for pyrethroid-PBO nets, further prioritization will be required to target any pyrethroid-PBO nets within the country. WHO recommends that within eligible areas, those
    with the highest malaria burden are prioritized.For other types of new ITNs, no deployment guidance has been developed as this would normally accompany a WHO policy recommendation. WHO recognizes that some Member States may be interested in deploying new types of ITNs not covered by specific policy
    recommendations, for example to start generating local cost-effectiveness evidence to inform national prioritization processes or as part of an insecticide resistance management strategy.In the absence of such a WHO policy recommendation and associated deployment guidance, WHO Member States that wish to deploy Interceptor® G2 or Royal Guard® are advised in the meantime to ensure any deployment supports building the local
    evidence base, with the ultimate aim of generating cost-effectiveness estimates to inform national prioritization processes. Consideration should be given to the ability of the health system and/or national research partners to generate data on the
    effectiveness of the chosen products in the local context. Areas targeted should be those where pyrethroid resistance in the main malaria vector(s) has been confirmed using WHO Test procedures for insecticide resistance monitoring. In principle, the targeting of high(er) endemicity areas should be considered, with a view to achieving maximum impact. Consideration should also be given to the need to sustain access to these or similar tools if additional epidemiological impact
    is demonstrated in the ongoing trials.WHO recommends that WHO Member States considering deploying Interceptor® G2 or Royal Guard® do so only as part of a wider decision-making exercise on the most effective use of available malaria control funding. WHO further advises that any such
    deployment should not come at the expense of reducing existing ITN coverage."
Is there a specific threshold at which pyrethroid-only LLINs fail to work? Is there a specific pyrethroid-resistance threshold at which a switch to a new type of ITN is recommended by WHO?,"There is no specific resistance threshold at which pyrethroid-only LLINs are considered to fail or at which these nets should be withdrawn from targeted areas. A WHO-coordinated multi-country study comparing net users with non-users living in areas where the main malaria vectors had developed pyrethroid resistance has shown that, irrespective of pyrethroid resistance, users of nets were significantly better protected from malaria than non-users.
    WHO recommends that, irrespective of pyrethroid resistance, populations in malaria-endemic areas should continue to use pyrethroid-only LLINs to reduce their risk of infection. Nevertheless, the multi-country study indicated that pyrethroid-only LLINs
    provide only partial protection against malaria. To achieve the targets set out in the Global technical strategy for malaria 2016–2030,
 WHO recognizes that the integration of new interventions, including new types of nets, will be essential. Such integration should be informed by evidence of the public health value of the new interventions.Guidance on the selection of malaria vector control interventions based on insecticide resistance data is provided in section 3.1 of the 
Guidelines for malaria vector control
. For pyrethroid-PBO ITNs, this guidance is consistent with that provided earlier in this Q&A document and in the corresponding  policy recommendation. Interceptor®
 G2 and Royal Guard® are currently not included in this guidance due to the absence of a specific WHO policy recommendation; guidance for countries considering deploying these products in the meantime is provided under the question ""When should a country consider purchasing a new type of ITN?"""
What is the scale-back strategy in the event that new types of ITNs not currently covered by WHO policy recommendations fail to demonstrate public health value?,"In the event that public health value cannot be demonstrated by Interceptor® G2 or Royal Guard®, no WHO policy recommendation will be issued, and therefore, the current WHO prequalification listing of these two products would be reviewed. WHO Member States that chose to deploy these new types of ITNs would then be able to phase them out during the next mass distribution campaign and through their routine systems.  With new types of ITNs being at least as effective as pyrethroid-only LLINs, no harm will have been done."
What messages should the national malaria control programme communicate with respect to new types of ITNs to communities and authorities in malaria-endemic areas?,"It is recommended that communication on new types of ITNs be informed by currently available evidence on their likely impact, rather than by assumptions. Managing expectations at this time – where evidence of public health value of new types of ITNs is scarce – is crucial. A framework to inform the development of a communications strategy, as developed by the Alliance for Malaria Prevention, is provided at the following link."
What is the Unitaid/Global Fund ‘New Nets Project’?,"The project aims to increase the evidence base for new nets and reduce the cost to an affordable level to facilitate scale-up should these nets receive a WHO policy recommendation. The project includes the following components:Randomized controlled trials to produce the robust epidemiological evidence needed for WHO to consider making a policy recommendation around these nets.Support procurement of volumes of the new nets that allow a limited number of pilots to take place and can be used as leverage to negotiate lower prices for these new nets.Support effectiveness pilots in four key eco-epidemiological settings within sub-Saharan Africa to help develop a better understanding of the relative cost-effectiveness of these tools compared to standard nets (and in some cases
        to PBO nets). These will be undertaken in 4 sites: Burkina Faso, Mozambique, Nigeria and Rwanda. These pilots will be conducted within an intense evaluative framework. Support other ‘operational’ pilots in limited areas where the focus is on allowing early access to these new tools in areas that may particularly benefit from any additional impact, collect operational experience to inform
        lessons learned on conducting national campaigns with multiple types of nets, and support the procurement of the volumes required to bring the price of the product down to an affordable level by the end of the project. The ‘New Nets Project’ supports work on Interceptor® G2 and Royal Guard®, not on pyrethroid-PBO nets."

If any of the information presented here is unclear or if specific questions of relevance in your context have not been included, please let us know. Send us your feedback and questions at vcguidelines@who.int."
When should a UTN be obtained?,"It is recommended that the UTN be obtained as soon as the 
first draft of the protocol has been compiled, although it can be 
obtained either sooner or later. For example:as soon as an investigator has an ideaas soon as the idea becomes a research proposalat the time the first draft of the protocol is compiledat the time the first meeting is held to discuss the protocolat the time the first meeting of potential investigators is heldA UTN may be obtained later in the trial's history (e.g. at 
the time of submission to the first ethics committee, or at the time of 
submission to a funding agency). It is likely to be more effective in 
unambiguously identifying a trial, though, if it is obtained early."
How can we obtain a UTN?,"Go to www.who.int/trialsearch/utn.aspx and follow the instructions.The process of obtaining a UTN involves 2 stages:applying for and obtaining a security codeapplying for and obtaining the UTNTo apply for the security code, the applicant will need to provide:the name of the individual submitting the request (Requestor)the email address of the individual submitting the requestthe Requestor's organizationAn email containing a secure hyperlink will then be sent to 
the email address entered. You should click on the hyperlink which will 
take you to the 'Get UTN' web site, where you should click on 'Get UTN'.
 The UTN will then be sent to you in an email."
Who should obtain the UTN?,"The Sponsor, the Principal Investigator or other appropriate 
person (for example, the administrator of a collaborative trials group) 
should obtain a UTN for each trial."
How many UTNs should a trial have?,One only.
What should we do with the UTN?,"You should use it every time you need to identify the trial. The 
UTN should be submitted whenever the trial is registered. It may be 
entered into a field dedicated specifically to the UTN, or it may be 
entered into the secondary identifier field."
Is the UTN mandatory?,"No, the UTN is not currently mandatory, although some registries 
may choose to make providing the UTN mandatory in order to register a 
trial on their registry."
What should we do if a trial registry does not have a separate field for the UTN?,"If a trial registry does not have a specific field for the UTN, enter it in the secondary identifier field.No, the UTN is not currently mandatory, although some registries 
may choose to make providing the UTN mandatory in order to register a 
trial on their registry."
Who is responsible for registering a trial?,"An appropriate representative of the trial’s primary Sponsor.
 The Responsible Registrant is responsible for ensuring that the trial 
is properly registered. The primary Sponsor may or may not be the 
primary funder. The responsible registrant should make every reasonable 
effort to ensure that a trial is registered once and only once in any 
one register, and that the trial is registered in the fewest number of 
registers necessary to meet applicable regulations."
When should trials be registered?,Trials should be registered before the first participant is recruited.
Can I register with the WHO ICTRP?,"No, WHO does not maintain its own registry so you cannot register your trial directly with us."
What information needs to be registered?,"The minimum information that must be registered is specified in the WHO Trial Registration Data Set. Individual registers may request more information than this (e.g., study sites)."
Are there software or hardware specifications that should be followed for building a trial registry?,"Yes, please contact us."
How many times should a trial be registered?,"To meet WHO requirements for transparency and publication it is 
only necessary for your trial to be to registered once, in either a Primary Registry or an ICMJE approved registry."
How to cite a record on a clinical trials register,"Please read this document, pdf 21kb"
When to cite a record on a clinical trials register,"The registry record will be the only publicly available 
document on a trial until results from the trial are published. Some 
examples of situations when studies might be quoted are:When a manuscript reporting the results of the trial is published or otherwise reportedWhen a manuscript reporting methodological issues relating to a particular trial are published or otherwise reportedIn protocols to systematic reviews, or in completed systematic reviews (e.g. when a list of ongoing trials are included)In protocols to prospective meta-analyses, which will list the ongoing trials to be includedIn any manuscript when reference to an ongoing or unpublished (or even published) trial might be relevant"
What is trial registration?,"WHO regards trial registration as the publication of an internationally-agreed set of information
 about the design, conduct and administration of clinical trials. These 
details are published on a publicly-accessible website managed by a 
registry conforming to WHO standards.What is the ICTRP?The ICTRP is a global initiative that aims to make information
 about all clinical trials involving humans publicly available. It also 
aims to:To improve the comprehensiveness, completeness and accuracy of registered clinical trial dataTo communicate and raise awareness of the need to register clinical trialsTo ensure the accessibility of registered data To build capacity for clinical trial registrationTo encourage the utilization of registered dataTo ensure the sustainability of the ICTRP"
What does the ICTRP do?,The ICTRP:Publishes the ICTRP Search PortalSupports the WHO Registry NetworkSupports countries and regions wanting to establish WHO-compliant clinical trial registries or policies on trial registration.
How does the ICTRP support countries and regions?,"If an agency in a member state (such as a Ministry of Health 
or a National Regulatory Authority) is interested in establishing a new 
clinical trial registry that complies with WHO criteria (or improving an
 existing registry), or in establishing policies that require 
registration in an existing Primary Registry, then they can approach the
 ICTRP for support. The types of support requested will vary and depend 
on the specific needs of the member state. It may include:Advice on how to meet the criteria required by a Primary Registry in the WHO Registry NetworkThe different models for achieving trial registration and the 
need to work with key agencies such as regulatory authorities and 
research ethics committees (or Institutional Review Boards) to ensure 
complianceDatabase and software issues, including data interchange standardsDeveloping and implementing standard operating procedures to ensure high quality dataFacilitating collaboration with other member states, particularly those in the same region or those that speak the same languageThe ICTRP works with only 1 registry per member state, and 
encourages collaboration across member states to build regional 
solutions, particularly when languages are shared. If a member state has
 more than one registry then it is up to that member state to determine 
which one will be the national registry."
What is seasonal influenza?,"Seasonal influenza (or “flu”) is most often caused by type A 
or B influenza viruses. Symptoms include sudden onset of fever, cough 
(usually dry), headache, muscle and joint pain, sore throat and a runny 
nose. The cough can be severe and can last 2 or more weeks. Most people 
recover from fever and other symptoms within a week without requiring 
medical attention. However, influenza can cause severe illness or death 
in high-risk groups (see Who is most at risk? below).   Seasonal epidemics occur mainly during winter, from October to
 March in the northern hemisphere and April to September in the southern
 hemisphere. In tropical and subtropical countries, seasonal influenza 
can happen all year round."
How can I avoid getting the flu?,"The best way to avoid getting the flu is to get the flu 
vaccine every year. Influenza viruses evolve constantly, and twice a 
year WHO makes recommendations to update the vaccine compositions. For 
the 2016-2017 northern hemisphere influenza season, the vaccine 
formulation was updated in February 2016 to contain two type A viruses 
(H1N1 and H3N2), and a type B virus. 

WHO recommends annual vaccination for high-risk groups 
including health care workers. People should ideally get vaccinated just
 before the influenza season begins for the most effective coverage, 
although getting vaccinated at any time during the influenza season can 
still help prevent flu infections."
Who is most at risk?,"People most at risk for severe seasonal influenza are:pregnant women at any stage of pregnancychildren younger than 5 yearspeople older than 65 yearspeople with chronic medical conditions such as HIV/AIDS, asthma, heart and lung diseases and diabetespeople with increased risk of exposure to influenza, which includes health care workers."
How is it treated?,"People with the flu should drink plenty of water and rest.   Most 
people will recover within a week.  Antiviral drugs for influenza can 
reduce severe complications and deaths although influenza viruses can 
develop resistance to the drugs. They are especially important for 
high-risk groups. Ideally these drugs need to be administered early 
(within 48 hours of onset of symptoms). Antibiotics are not effective 
against influenza viruses."
How do you stop it from spreading?,"Influenza can spread quickly between people when an infected 
person coughs or sneezes, dispersing droplets of the virus into the air.
 It can be also spread by hands contaminated by the virus. 

Precautionary measures should be taken to limit transmission. 
People should cover their mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing, 
then throw it out and wash their hands thoroughly and regularly."
Is seasonal influenza linked to pandemic flu?,"Seasonal influenza outbreaks are caused by small changes in 
viruses that have already circulated, and to which many people have some
 immunity.

A pandemic occurs when an influenza virus emerges that most 
people do not have immunity from because it is so different from any 
previous strain in humans. This enables the strain to spread easily 
between people.

Seasonal influenza viruses may contribute to the emergence of a
 pandemic virus; and once a pandemic virus has been established, as with
 the pandemic A(H1N1) in 2009, it can become a seasonal virus."
How will the UTN work?,"The UTN will be one of many identifiers that a trial may have,
 just as a driving license number may be one of many identifiers that an
 individual human has. Even though a single object has multiple 
identifiers, each one may play a role in helping to identify the object.
 When an individual applies for a passport, for example, they may be 
required to show 3 forms of identification (such as driving license 
number, a credit card number, a utilities bill number) to verify that an
 individual exists. Similarly, when a trial is registered, multiple 
identifiers may be able to help us to verify that a trial exists.The UTN will help us to unambiguously identify a trial by enabling us to link (or ""bridge"") multiple records on the same trial together on the ICTRP search portal."
What if my trial was registered before the UTN?,"We recognize that in some circumstances, a trial registered 
prior to the inception of the UTN may request retrospective assignment. 
 UTN numbers may be issued for previously registered trials.In order to avoid duplication of records and permit accurate 
record bridging on the ICTRP, it is strongly suggested that only the 
coordinating centre apply for the UTN. Once the UTN has been assigned, 
the coordinating centre should update all records within primary 
registers and on all other documentation (e.g., ethical review committee
 submissions, letters, etc) to reflect the UTN.Remember a trial, no matter how many sites should have only one UTN.Circumstances where retrospective UTN applications may be considered are:proposal, registered (not yet enrolling)trial registered and enrolment terminatedtrial registered, still enrolling, no new sitestrial registered, still enrolling, adding a new siteAs the primary purpose of the UTN is to identify a trial 
through stages of a clinical trial (including registration, approvals, 
trial recruitment, and participant follow up), the utility of a UTN 
following trial completion and/or publication is currently limited.  
While it is possible to apply for a UTN, it is again strongly suggested 
that this be a centralized process and that all documentation be linked 
to the UTN, retrospectively."
Polio is a disease you read about in history books. Does it still exist? Is it curable?,"Polio does still exist, although polio cases have decreased by over 99% since 1988, from an estimated more than 350 000 cases to 22 reported cases in 2017. This reduction is the result of the global effort to eradicate the disease. Today, only 3 countries in the world have never stopped transmission of polio Pakistan, Afghanistan and Nigeria).
Despite the progress achieved since 1988, as long as a single
child remains infected with poliovirus, children in all countries are at
risk of contracting the disease. The poliovirus can easily be imported
into a polio-free country and can spread rapidly amongst unimmunized
populations. Failure to eradicate polio could result in as many as 200
000 new cases every year, within 10 years, all over the world.
There is no cure for polio, it can only be prevented. Polio vaccine, given multiple times, can protect a child for life.

Does stopping a course of antibiotics early lead to antibiotic resistance?,"There has been a lot of research into how long antibiotic 
courses should be, to determine the shortest possible length of course 
needed to completely kill all bacteria.
		If you are being treated for an infection, the kind of 
antibiotics your doctor prescribes and the length of the course should 
be based on the best evidence.Feeling better, or an improvement in symptoms, does not always
 mean that the infection has completely gone. Your doctor has had years 
of training and has access to the latest evidence – so always follow 
their advice. Evidence is emerging that shorter courses of antibiotics may 
be just as effective as longer courses for some infections. Shorter 
treatments make more sense – they are more likely to be completed 
properly, have fewer side effects and also likely to be cheaper. They 
also reduce the exposure of bacteria to antibiotics, thereby reducing 
the speed by which the pathogen develops resistance. WHO publishes guidelines about treatments for different 
infections and recommends treatment durations and doses of antibiotics 
based on the best clinical evidence for each case. We continuously 
review the latest research so that we can provide updated 
recommendations to health professionals."
What is a Primary Registry?,"A Primary Registry in the WHO Registry Network is a clinical trial registry with at least a national remit that meets WHO Registry Criteria
 for content, quality and validity, accessibility, unique 
identification, technical capacity and governance and administration. 
Primary Registries have the support of the ICMJE."
How does a registry become a Primary Registry in the WHO Registry Network?,"The ICTRP is a country-led initiative. Clinical trial 
registration happens when countries seek to improve the transparency of 
clinical trial research involving nationals of that country, and to be 
more accountable to the individuals who consent to participate in 
clinical research, and to better oversee and monitor that research. It 
is up to each country to decide if they want to have a clinical trial 
registry and, if so, where that registry will be housed.To become a Primary Registry in the WHO Registry Network a registry must:Submit a Registry Profile (available from the ICTRP Secretariat)Meet all of the WHO Registry CriteriaBe approved by the Assistant Director General of the Information Evidence and Research cluster of the World Health OrganizationView the list Primary Registries in the WHO Registry Network. Only registries on this list meet WHO requirements.
				The designation as a Primary Registry in the WHO Registry 
Network is conditional on continuing compliance with WHO Registry 
criteria."
What should I do if I want to take part in clinical trial?,"If you are patient or family member and you find a trial that 
is of interest we suggest that you print out the information and discuss
 it with your health care provider. They should be able to advise you on
 the appropriate course of action.If you are a health care provider or researcher you should approach one of the contact persons listed in the registered record."
What is avian influenza?,"Avian influenza viruses normally spread between birds. However, some viruses have been found to infect humans.When avian influenza infects humans, symptoms may range from 
mild upper respiratory infection (fever and cough) to severe pneumonia, 
acute respiratory distress syndrome (difficulty breathing), shock and 
even death."
Who is at risk for avian influenza?,"The primary risk factor for humans is exposure to infected 
live or dead poultry or contaminated environments, such as live bird 
markets. Slaughtering, defeathering, handling carcasses and preparing 
poultry for consumption, especially in household settings, are also risk
 factors.Although human-to-human transmission of avian influenza is 
thought to have occurred in some instances when there had been close or 
prolonged contact with a patient, no sustained human-to-human 
transmission has been identified to date."
How can human infections with avian influenza be prevented?,"As much as possible, residents and travellers in countries with known outbreaks of avian influenza in birds should avoid:poultry farmscontact with animals in live poultry marketsentering areas where poultry may be slaughteredcontact with any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with faeces from poultry or other animalsconsumption of raw or incompletely cooked meat or eggs.Good food safety and hand hygiene practices should also be followed, including regular handwashing with soap and water."
What should you do if you think someone may have avian influenza?,"Seek medical care immediately if you live in or have recently 
visited an area experiencing an outbreak and you are suffering flu-like 
symptoms such as fever, cough and difficulty breathing.If you or someone close is experiencing flu-like symptoms, take protective measures:Regular handwashing with proper drying of the handsGood respiratory hygiene – covering mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing, using tissues and disposing of them correctlyEarly self-isolation of those feeling unwell, feverish and having other symptomsAvoid close contact with people with respiratory symptoms"
"Is it safe to eat meat or animal products, such as eggs, from areas with outbreaks of avian influenza?","Meat products and eggs can be safely consumed, provided they 
are properly prepared because influenza viruses are inactivated by 
thorough cooking. Please see ""How can meat and eggs be safely prepared?” for detailed information. Consuming raw or incompletely cooked meat and eggs from areas 
experiencing outbreaks of avian influenza is high-risk and should be 
avoided. Likewise, animals that are sick or have died unexpectedly 
should not be eaten."
How can meat and eggs be safely prepared?,"To avoid contamination, always keep raw meat and eggs separate from
 cooked or ready-to-eat foods. Do not use the same chopping board or the
 same knife for raw meat and other foods, and do not place cooked meat 
back on the same plate or surface it was on before cooking. After 
handling raw meat, wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water. Do 
not eat raw or soft-boiled eggs. Wash and disinfect all surfaces and 
utensils that have been in contact with raw meat."
How can violence against children be prevented?,"There are two distinct types of violence experienced by 
children (defined by the United Nations as anyone aged 0-18 years) - 
child maltreatment by parents and caregivers in children aged 0-14, and 
violence occurring in community settings among adolescents aged 15-18 
years. These different types of violence can be prevented by addressing 
the underlying causes and risk factors specific to each type.
		Child maltreatment by parents and caregivers can be prevented by:reducing unintended pregnancies;     reducing harmful levels of alcohol and illicit drug use during pregnancy;reducing harmful levels of alcohol and illicit drug use by new parents;improving access to high quality pre- and post-natal services; providing home visitation services by professional nurses and 
social workers to families where children are at high-risk of 
maltreatment;providing training for parents on child development, non-violent discipline and problem-solving skills.Violence involving children in community settings can be prevented through:pre-school enrichment programmes to give young children an educational head start; life skills training;assisting high-risk adolescents to complete schooling;reducing alcohol availability through the enactment and enforcement of liquor licensing laws, taxation and pricing;restricting access to firearms.Improving the efficiency of pre-hospital and emergency medical
 care will reduce  the risk of death, the time for recovery and the 
level of long-term impairment due to violence. All violence against children and especially child 
maltreatment occurring in the first decade of life is both a problem in 
itself and a major risk factor for other forms of violence and health 
problems through a person's life. For instance, a WHO study estimated 
that the lifetime impact of child sexual abuse accounts for 
approximately 6% of cases of depression, 6% of alcohol and drug 
abuse/dependence, 8% of suicide attempts, 10% of panic disorders and 27%
 of post traumatic stress disorders. Other studies have also linked 
child physical abuse, sexual abuse and other childhood adversities to 
excessive smoking, eating disorders, and high-risk sexual behaviour, 
which in turn are associated with some of the leading causes of death 
including cancers and cardiovascular disorders.WHO supports countries to collect data and information related
 to violence against children, develop national violence prevention 
policies and programmes, and create systems for the provision of 
appropriate medico-legal and emergency trauma care.Related linksChild maltreatment preventionTogether for girls: sexual violence against girlsUNICEF Child ProtectionSpecial Representatives of the United Nations Secretary General on Violence against Children"
What is universal health coverage?,"The goal of universal health coverage is to ensure that all 
people obtain the health services they need without suffering financial 
hardship when paying for them. For a community or country to achieve universal health coverage, several factors must be in place, including:A strong, efficient, well-run health system that meets priority 
health needs through people-centred integrated care (including services 
for HIV, tuberculosis, malaria, noncommunicable diseases, maternal and 
child health) by: informing and encouraging people to stay healthy and prevent illness;detecting health conditions early;having the capacity to treat disease; andhelping patients with rehabilitation. Affordability – a system for financing health services so people 
do not suffer financial hardship when using them.  This can be achieved 
in a variety of ways. Access to essential medicines and technologies to diagnose and treat medical problems.A sufficient capacity of well-trained, motivated health workers 
to provide the services to meet patients’ needs based on the best 
available evidence. It also requires recognition of the critical role played by 
all sectors in assuring human health, including transport, education and
 urban planning.Universal health coverage has a direct impact on a 
population’s health.  Access to health services enables people to be 
more productive and active contributors to their families and 
communities. It also ensures that children can go to school and learn. 
At the same time, financial risk protection prevents people from being 
pushed into poverty when they have to pay for health services out of 
their own pockets. Universal health coverage is thus a critical 
component of sustainable development and poverty reduction, and a key 
element of any effort to reduce social inequities. Universal coverage is
 the hallmark of a government’s commitment to improve the wellbeing of 
all its citizens. Universal coverage is firmly based on the WHO constitution of 
1948 declaring health a fundamental human right and on the Health for 
All agenda set by the Alma-Ata declaration in 1978. Equity is paramount.
 This means that countries need to track progress not just across the 
national population but within different groups (e.g. by income level, 
sex, age, place of residence, migrant status and ethnic origin)."
Is it safe to visit live poultry markets and farms?,"To avoid contamination, always keep raw meat and eggs separate from
 cooked or ready-to-eat foods. Do not use the same chopping board or the
 same knife for raw meat and other foods, and do not place cooked meat 
back on the same plate or surface it was on before cooking. After 
handling raw meat, wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water. Do 
not eat raw or soft-boiled eggs. Wash and disinfect all surfaces and 
utensils that have been in contact with raw meat."
Is there a vaccine against avian influenza?,"No vaccine for the prevention of avian influenza infections in
 humans is commercially available. WHO is working with partners on 
vaccine development. Some products are already being tested for efficacy
 and safety.The seasonal influenza vaccine does not prevent avian 
influenza, but it may reduce the likelihood of being simultaneously 
infected with both avian and seasonal influenza viruses (dual 
infections). Reducing dual infections decreases the likelihood of 
viruses gaining the ability to spread easily from person to person."
Is it safe to travel to areas reporting human cases of avian influenza?,"WHO does not recommend travel restrictions related to avian 
influenza. However, travellers can take certain measures to reduce the 
risk of infection. Please see ""How can human infections with avian influenza be prevented?"""
What are malnutrition and starvation?,"Malnutrition comes in many forms. Simply put, it means poor nutrition. It includes:

undernutrition: when a person does not get enough food to eat,
    causing them to be wasted (this is also called acute malnutrition, when
    someone is too thin for their height) and/or stunted (this is also
    called chronic malnutrition, when someone is too short for their age).
    Undernutrition increases the risk of infectious diseases like diarrhoea,
    measles, malaria and pneumonia, and chronic malnutrition can impair a
    young child’s physical and mental development.
micronutrient deficiencies: when a person does not get enough
    important vitamins and minerals in their diet. Micronutrient
    deficiencies can lead to poor health and development, particularly in
    children and pregnant women.
overweight and obesity: linked to an unbalanced or unhealthy diet
    resulting in eating too many calories and often associated with lack of
    exercise. Overweight and obesity can lead to diet-related
    noncommunicable diseases such as heart disease, high blood pressure
    (hypertension), stroke, diabetes and cancer.

Starvation is a severe lack of food which can result in death."
How big a problem is malnutrition in emergencies?,"In emergencies, people are at higher risk of undernutrition 
and micronutrient deficiencies. Those whose nutrition was poor before 
the crisis are even more vulnerable. Acute malnutrition weakens the 
immune system, which then becomes more susceptible to developing 
diseases that can be fatal.

Undernutrition and micronutrient deficiencies can be 
widespread among refugees and displaced people, as adequate food and 
health services are often not readily accessible.

Inadequate nutrition and repeated bouts of infection during 
the first 1000 days of a child’s life can cause stunting, which has 
irreversible long-term effects on the physical and mental development of
 children. Worldwide in 2015, there were 156 million stunted children, 
about 45% of them living in fragile and conflict-affected countries.Emergencies can also aggravate diet-related noncommunicable 
disease, such as heart disease, high blood pressure (hypertension), 
diabetes and cancer. Healthy foods may not be regularly available and 
appropriate medical care may not be accessible, leading to the 
interruption or cessation of treatments for these diseases. Given that 
many populations have high levels of noncommunicable diseases, 
emergencies can cause a significant increase in illness and even death 
from these diseases."
Who is most vulnerable to undernutrition and starvation during emergencies?,"Young children and women who are pregnant or breastfeeding are
 most vulnerable to undernutrition. Their bodies have a greater need for
 nutrients, such as vitamins and minerals, and are more susceptible to 
the harmful consequences of deficiencies.

Children are at the highest risk of dying from starvation. 
They become undernourished faster than adults. Severely wasted children 
are 11 times more likely to die than those with a healthy weight. 
Undernourished children catch infections more easily and have a harder 
time recovering because their immune systems are impaired. Globally, 
undernutrition is an underlying factor in more than half of child deaths
 from pneumonia and malaria, and more than 40% of measles deaths."
How should severe acute malnutrition be treated in an emergency?,"Severe acute malnutrition is when a person is extremely thin 
and at risk of dying. They need immediate treatment. The response to 
acute malnutrition is broad and includes several elements such as 
medical, food, water and hygiene, and social services.


Children who still have an appetite can stay at home and 
receive outpatient care. They need treatment with specially-formulated 
foods, and their recovery must be monitored regularly by a trained 
health worker.
Children who have medical problems and do not have an appetite
 need inpatient care in a clinic or hospital. They need 
specially-formulated milks and treatment for infections or other 
potential complications."
Why is it so important for infants to breastfeed during emergencies?,"Breastfeeding can be life-saving for young children in emergencies.

Breastfeeding in all environments has major health benefits 
for both children and mothers. Breast milk gives infants all the 
nutrients they need for healthy growth and development. It is readily 
available and contains antibodies that protect infants from common 
childhood illnesses. Breastfeeding also reduces mothers’ risks of breast
 and ovarian cancer, type II diabetes, and postpartum depression. Breastfeeding becomes even more critical for child survival in
 humanitarian emergencies. Young children in emergencies face higher 
risks of diarrhoea, pneumonia and undernutrition. Lack of food, unsafe 
water, poor sanitation, overcrowding and overburdened health systems put
 infants and young children at greater risk. 

WHO recommends that all babies should be fed only breast milk 
for the first 6 months, after which they should continue breastfeeding 
(as well as eating other foods) until 2 years of age, and potentially 
for longer, even in emergency situations."
What are the challenges to breastfeeding in emergency situations?,"Often the poor physical and mental health of mothers in 
emergencies leads to poor breastfeeding outcomes. Displaced mothers may 
struggle to find comfortable, private places to breastfeed and their 
support network of family and friends is often not accessible in 
emergencies. Health workers who would usually offer support may be 
redeployed to cope with other aspects of the emergency response. 

Well-meaning donors may distribute breast-milk substitutes 
(such as infant formula) in emergencies. This can undermine 
breastfeeding and, if there is a lack of clean water to make formula or 
clean bottles and teats, put children at increased risk of infections 
which can be deadly.Governments and humanitarian organizations have a key role to 
play in protecting, promoting and supporting breastfeeding in 
emergencies."
"Why was the ""WHO European Conference on the New European Policy for Health - Health 2020"" organized to be held in Jerusalem?","WHO appreciates the concerns expressed by several countries and
 NGOs regarding the decision of the WHO European Regional Office to hold
 a ""WHO European Conference on the New European Policy for Health - 
Health 2020"" in Jerusalem on 28-29 November 2011.
		The Director-General has discussed this issue with the parties
 concerned, and worked closely with the Regional Director to find a 
suitable alternative location for the meeting.The Director-General affirms that WHO will align itself with the UN position and practice of not holding meetings in Jerusalem."
Are people living with HIV at increased risk of being infected with the virus that causes COVID-19?,"People living with HIV with advanced disease, those with low CD4 and high viral load and those who are not taking antiretroviral treatment have an increased risk of infections and related complications in general.  It is unknown if the immunosuppression of HIV will put a person at greater risk for COVID-19, thus, until more is known, additional precautions for all people with advanced HIV or poorly controlled HIV, should be employed[1],[2].At present there is no evidence that the risk of infection or complications of COVID-19 is different among people living with HIV who are clinically and immunologically stable on antiretroviral treatment when compared with the general population.  Some people living with HIV may have known risk factors for COVID-19 complications, such as diabetes, hypertension and other noncommunicable diseases and as such may have increased risk of COVID-19 unrelated to HIV.  We know that during the SARS and MERS outbreaks there were only a few case reports of mild disease among people living with HIV.  To date, there is a case report of a person living with HIV who had COVID-19 and recovered[3] and a small study on risk factors and antiretrovirals used among people living with HIV with COVID-19 from China.  This study reported similar rates of COVID-19 disease as compared to the entire population and increased risk with older age, but not with low CD4, high viral load level or antiretroviral regimen[4]. Current clinical data suggest the main mortality risk factors are linked to older age and other comorbidities including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and hypertension. Some very healthy people have also developed severe disease from the coronavirus infection[5].  PLHIV are advised to take the same precautions as the general population[6],[7]: wash hands oftencough etiquette physical distancingseek medical care if symptomaticself-isolation if in contact with someone with COVID-19 and other actions per the government response   People living with HIV who are taking antiretroviral drugs should ensure that they have at least 30 days and up to 6-month supply of medicines and ensure that their vaccinations are up to date (influenza and pneumococcal vaccines). Adequate supplies of medicines to treat co-infections and comorbidities and addiction should also be ensured."
Can antiretrovirals be used to treat COVID-19?,"Several studies have suggested that patients infected with the virus causing COVID-19, and the related coronavirus infections (SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV) had good clinical outcomes, with almost all cases recovering fully.  In some cases, patients were given an antiretroviral drug: lopinavir boosted with ritonavir (LPV/r). These studies were mostly carried out in HIV-negative individuals.It is important to note that these studies using LPV/r had important limitations. The studies were small, timing, duration and dosing for treatment were varied and most patients received co-interventions/co-treatments which may have contributed to the reported outcomes. While the evidence of benefit of using antiretrovirals to treat coronavirus infections is of very low certainty, serious side effects were rare. Among people living with HIV, the routine use of LPV/r as treatment for HIV is associated with several side effects of moderate severity. However, as the duration of treatment in patients with coronavirus infections was generally limited to a few weeks, these occurrences can be expected to be low or less than that reported from routine use."
Can antiretrovirals be used to prevent COVID-19 infection?,"Two studies have reported the use of LPV/r as post-exposure prophylaxis for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. One of these studies suggested that the occurrence of MERS-CoV infection was lower among health workers receiving LPV/r compared to those who did not receive any drugs; the other study found no cases of SARS-CoV infection among 19 people living with HIV hospitalized in the same ward of SARS patients, of whom 11 were on antiretroviral therapy. Again, the certainty of the evidence is very low due to small sample size, variability in drugs provided, and uncertainty regarding intensity of exposure."
What studies on treatment and prevention of COVID-19 with antiretrovirals are being planned?,"Several randomized trials are planned to assess the safety and efficacy of using antiretroviral drugs – mainly LPV/r – for treating COVID-19, in combination with other drugs. Results are expected from mid-2020 onwards."
How has the tobacco industry previously manipulated people and attracted new users?,"As awareness of the harms of tobacco use grew and global tobacco control efforts intensified over the last decade, social acceptability of tobacco use declined. This catalysed the tobacco industry to revisit old tactics to restore its tarnished reputation
    and secure a new generation of users. The tobacco industry has made well-researched, calculated attempts to redesign and rebrand its products to sustain profitability. It introduced cigarette filters and the so-called “light” and “mild” tobacco products as an alternative
    to quitting, reducing tobacco users’ perceptions of risk and harm, and undermining effective tobacco control policies. Such misleading marketing continues today, with the industry advocating for the harm reduction approach
    through new products such as electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) and electronic non-nicotine delivery systems (ENNDS), commonly referred to as ‘e-cigarettes’, and heated tobacco products (HTPs)."
How are tobacco and related industries marketing new and emerging products?,"E-cigarettes are often promoted as “reduced risk”, “smoke-free”, “socially acceptable” consumer products. These promotional strategies have the potential to renormalize smoking and drive long-term use of addictive nicotine
    products which, like tobacco, are undoubtedly harmful to the consumer, under the guise of being a healthier alternative. Tobacco and related industries exploit the fact that the long-term health effects of e-cigarettes have not been established and
    they are not yet regulated in most countries, enabling them to work around tobacco advertising bans and promote use of their products in smoke-free environments. Some manufacturers also tend to talk about e-cigarettes with HTPs together, thereby confusing potential consumers, and making it difficult to tell the difference between a tobacco and a non-tobacco product. These social-positioning techniques, coupled
    with strategic marketing tactics, are particularly effective in targeting children and adolescents and have the potential to sustain nicotine addiction in youth globally."
What sponsorship schemes are used to manipulate children and adolescents?,"Celebrity and influencer endorsements. Advertising is increasingly shifting to social media platforms, and the nicotine and tobacco industries are no different. “Influencers” on social media who reach and engage children
        and adolescents are invited by these industries to serve as “brand ambassadors” or offered financial incentives to promote their products.  Social influencers have the potential to give their audiences the impression of more authentic
        promotion of the products, particularly when posts do not disclose the sponsorship details.Scholarships. Tobacco and ENDS-related entities have offered scholarships to high school, college and graduate students, some requiring applicants to submit essays on the dangers of tobacco and the potential benefits
        of ENDS use.School programmes and youth camps. Tobacco and
 ENDS-related entities have paid schools for the opportunity to speak in classrooms or after school. They have also sponsored summer camps to spread misconceptions about
        the risks of ENDS use and market their products under the guise of promoting “safer alternatives” to conventional tobacco products."
"What advertising tactics are used to target new, young consumers?","Digital and social media advertising. With the pervasiveness of smartphones and constant Internet access, nicotine and tobacco companies have strategically used digital and social media platforms to reach younger generations,
 including through their favourite apps and video games. Social media platforms allow users to interact with the marketing features, which increases exposure and influence among children and adolescents. They also allow marketers
        to access profile details of users and their friends and effectively target potential customers. Countries that have adopted advertising, promotion and sponsorship bans, but have not explicitly banned cross-border advertising, are
        susceptible to exposing their youth to digital and social media advertising originating from other countries. Just over 100 hashtags associated with tobacco companies have been viewed more than 25 billion times around the world between 2007-2016.Attractive displays in retail shops. Vendors near schools are frequently paid to display nicotine and tobacco products in their retail shops, along with sleek point-of-sale display boards, attractive marketing materials and bright,
        colourful cases to attract young customers.  Modern, attractive retail spaces with a wide variety of products that appeal to youth are also now commonly used to market new and novel products.Advertising materials and products at eye-level of children. In many countries, nicotine and tobacco products can be found at children’s eye levels and near shops selling toys, electronic gadgets, sweets, snacks or soda."
What marketing ploys are used to attract children and adolescents to nicotine and tobacco products?,"Flavours that appeal to youth. Tobacco products, such as smokeless and water pipe tobacco, are sold in sweet and fruity flavours, which may increase appeal to non-smokers and mask the harsh tobacco taste.  To date, researchers have identified over 15,000 e-cigarette flavours available, including flavours proven to appeal to youth, such as cotton candy and gummy bear.  Advertisements of flavoured products may enhance appeal and encourage children and adolescents to buy and try nicotine products. The flavours may lower perception of the harmfulness and addictiveness of nicotine products.Sleek, pocket-sized designs. ENDS and HTPs are extensively promoted as modern, high-tech and high-end lifestyle products, with minimalist designs, and high-profile product launches that portray them as attractive and harmless products. The sleek designs can be deceptive, available in shapes resembling a USB flash drive, and can be easily concealed in a young person’s hand.Cartoon characters. Some ENDS-related entities use cartoons and child-friendly imagery, such as unicorns, to brand their products and market sweet flavours."
What is WHO’s position on the use of antiretrovirals for the treatment of COVID-19?,"Currently, there is insufficient data to assess the effectiveness of LPV/r or other antivirals for treating COVID-19. Several countries are evaluating the use of LPV/r and other antivirals and we welcome the results of these investigations.Again, as part of WHO’s response to the outbreak, the WHO R&D Blueprint has been activated to accelerate evaluation of diagnostics, vaccines and therapeutics for this novel coronavirus. WHO has also designed a set of procedures to assess the performance, quality and safety of medical technologies during emergency situations."
What is WHO’s position on use of corticosteroids for the treatment of COVID-19?,The current interim guidance from WHO on clinical management of severe acute respiratory infection when COVID-19 infection is suspected advises against the use of corticosteroids unless indicated for another reason.[8]This guidance is based on several systematic reviews that cite lack of effectiveness and possible harm from routine treatment with corticosteroids for viral pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome.[9]
"If countries use antiretrovirals for COVID-19, are there concerns about treatment shortages for people living with HIV?","Antiretrovirals are an efficacious and highly tolerable treatment for people living with HIV. The antiretroviral LPV/r is currently being investigated as a possible treatment for COVID-19.If they are to be used for the treatment of COVID-19, a plan should be in place to ensure there is adequate and continuous supply to cover the needs of all people living with HIV already using LPV/r and those who will need to begin treatment. However, a relatively small proportion of people are on regimens which include LPV/r, since it is used as a second-line regimen according to WHO’s HIV treatment guidelines. Any country that allows the use of HIV medicines for the treatment of COVID-19 must ensure that an adequate and sustainable supply is in place."
How do we ensure human rights and reduce stigma and discrimination?,"As the world scales up public health responses to the COVID19 pandemic, countries are being urged to take decisive action to control the epidemic. WHO has urged all countries to ensure an appropriate balance between protecting health, preventing economic and social disruption, and respecting human rights.  WHO is working with partners including the UNAIDS Joint Programme and the Global Network of People Living with HIV to ensure that human rights are not eroded in the response to COVID-19 and to ensure that people living with or affected by HIV are offered the same access to services as others and to ensure HIV-related services continue without disruption.To mitigate potential prison outbreaks of COVID19 and reduce morbidity and mortality among people in prisons and other closed settings, it is crucial that prisons and immigration detention centres are embedded within the broader public health response. This requires close collaboration between health and justice ministries and includes protocols for entry screening, personal protection measures, physical distancing, environmental cleaning and disinfection, and restriction of movement, including limitation of transfers and access for non-essential staff and visitors.  In the current context it is of critical importance that countries work toward developing non-custodial strategies to prevent overcrowding in closed settings[10]. Governance of prison health by a ministry of health, rather than a ministry of justice or similar, is likely to facilitate this[11]."
How can programmes assure continued access to HIV services?,"It is important to assure continuous access to essential HIV prevention, testing and treatment services also where measurements of confinement are implemented within the public health response to the COVID-19 pandemic. While access to essential services should be maintained, adapted and evidence-based measures to reduce possible transmission should be considered and implemented.  These include[12]: Applying standard precautions for all patients (including ensuring that all patients cover their nose and mouth with a tissue or elbow when coughing or sneezing, offering a medical mask to patients with suspected COVID-19 infection while they are in waiting in the service, perform hand hygiene etc.) Health care and outreach      workers, as well as peer educators and clients should apply adapted hand      hygiene measuresEnsuring triage, early      recognition, and source control (isolating patients with suspected      COVID-19 infection)Ensure there is adequate      ventilation in all areas in the healthcare facilitySpatial separation of at least      1 metre should ideally be maintained between all patients within all types      of servicesCleaning and disinfection      procedures should be followed consistently and correctlyDispensing medicines (for treatment of HIV, TB and      other chronic conditions such as opioid dependence) for longer periods      allowing reduced frequency of patient visits Consider reduction of services to the most critical      ones (provision of essential treatment and prevention services; services      such as counselling sessions may be reduced or adapted)Generally, vulnerable populations, including members of key populations, as well as homeless and/or displaced people may be at increased risk of infection – because of additional comorbidities impacting on their immune system, reduced ability to apply measures of confinement and social distancing, as well as generally limited access to health services.  It is critical that services that reach these populations such as community-based services, drop-in centres and outreach services can continue providing life-saving prevention (distribution of condoms, needles and syringes), testing and treatment while securing safety of staff and clients. Services can be adapted according to above considerations where applicable."
What is the role multi-month prescriptions and dispensing for antiretrovirals and other medicines?,"Clinically stable adults, children, adolescents and pregnant and breastfeeding women as well as members of key populations (people who inject drugs, sex workers, men who have sex with men, transgender people and people living in prisons and closed settings) can benefit from simplified antiretroviral therapy delivery models which include multi-month prescriptions and dispensing (3-6 month supply) which will reduce the frequency of visits to clinical settings and ensures continuity of treatment during possible disruption of movements during the coronavirus outbreak.  Similar consideration should be given to providing people who are clinically stable on methadone or buprenorphine substitution therapy with an increased possibility for take-home medications to reduce additional burden on the health sector."
Can pregnant or postpartum women living with HIV transmit the COVID-19 virus to their unborn child or infant?,"There are few data on the clinical presentation of COVID-19 in specific populations, such as children and pregnant women[13] but findings from a small published study suggest that there is currently no evidence for intrauterine infection caused by vertical transmission in women who develop COVID-19 pneumonia in late pregnancy[14].  Although no vertical transmission has been documented, transmission after birth via contact with infectious respiratory secretions is a concern. Infants born to mothers with suspected, probable, or confirmed COVID-19 should be fed according to standard infant feeding guidelines[15], while applying necessary precautions for infection prevention and control (IPC).  As with all confirmed or suspected COVID-19 cases, symptomatic mothers who are breastfeeding or practicing skin-to-skin contact or kangaroo mother care should practice respiratory hygiene, including during feeding (for example, use of a medical mask when near a child if the mother has respiratory symptoms), perform hand hygiene before and after contact with the child, and routinely clean and disinfect surfaces with which the symptomatic mother has been in contact[16].   Q&A on COVID-19, pregnancy, childbirth and breastfeeding"
Should pregnant and breastfeeding women living with HIV with COVID-19 and their newborns be managed differently?,"There is currently no known difference between the clinical manifestations of COVID-19 or risk of severe illness or foetal compromise for pregnant and non-pregnant women or adults of reproductive age.  Pregnant and recently pregnant women with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 should be treated with supportive and management therapies, considering the immunologic and physiologic adaptations during and after pregnancy which may overlap with COVID-19 symptoms.  Data are limited but, until the evidence base provides clearer information, special consideration should be given to pregnant women with concomitant medical illnesses who could be infected with COVID-19. There are no reported deaths in pregnant women at time of publishing this information[17] however, COVID-19 testing of symptomatic pregnant women may need to be prioritized to enable access to specialized care.  All recently pregnant women with COVID-19 or who have recovered from COVID-19 should be provided with information and counselling on safe infant feeding and appropriate IPC measures to prevent COVID-19 virus transmission[18].With confirmed disease or under investigation, management is similar to non-pregnant women, with appropriate isolation of confirmed or under investigation.  Obstetric facilities must be notified and prepared, noting that each infant born to any mother with confirmed COVID-19 should be considered a ‘person under investigation’ and should be isolated according to the IPC guidance.  Currently, it is unknown whether newborns with COVID-19 are at increased risk for severe complications."
What promotional tactics are used to tempt children and adolescents?,"Product placement in entertainment media, such as television and cinema. 
Children and adolescents who watch movies and television shows containing depictions of smoking are at an increased risk of initiating smoking.  Exposure to tobacco products or e-cigarette marketing in entertainment media influences children and adolescents’ intention to use these products
.Free product samples. 
Nicotine and tobacco product samples are distributed in high traffic areas, and particularly venues frequented by youth, such as street corners, shopping malls, festivals and concerts, to attract new consumers. In over 50 countries, at least 10% of students aged 13-15 reported ever being offered a free cigarette by a tobacco company representative. 
Merchandise with company logos.
 In over 120 countries, at least 1 in 10 students aged 13-15 reported having an object with a tobacco company logo on it."
What distribution mechanisms are used to facilitate access to these products?,"Single stick cigarettes. The sale of cigarettes individually or in small packets increases the affordability and accessibility of tobacco products for school children. Young people that start experimenting with single stick
        cigarettes do not benefit from exposure to health warnings on cigarette packs. A recent investigation in 45 countries found that students aged 13-15 reported recently purchasing single cigarettes, and in some countries, as many as 80% of students
        reported purchasing single cigarettes .Disposable e-cigarettes. The option to test and toss different flavours of e-liquids, particularly for a low initial cost, has driven use of disposable e-cigarettes among children and adolescents.In some countries, where
        flavours are banned in refillable cartridge-based e-cigarettes, children and adolescents have turned to disposable e-cigarettes to continue using flavoured products.Vending machines. Tobacco vending machines provide young people with easy access to tobacco products without needing to provide a form of identification to verify age. In some countries, tobacco vending machines are placed in areas
        frequented by youth, such as near schools, with attractive advertising and pack displays.Internet sales. Nicotine and tobacco products sold online facilitate sale to minors, particularly where age verification mechanisms are not in place . Online sales also allow children and adolescents to purchase products
        being sold in other countries where regulations may differ."
How many malaria-affected countries have reported cases of COVID-19?,"Malaria-endemic countries in all WHO regions have reported cases of COVID-19. In the WHO African Region, which carries more than 90% of the global malaria burden, 37 countries had reported cases of the disease as of 25 March; of these, 10 countries reported local transmission of the disease. The latest situation reports on the COVID-19 pandemic are available on the WHO website."
Should core malaria vector control interventions be maintained in view of the rapid global spread of COVID-19?,"In recent days, there have been reports of the suspension of insecticide-treated net (ITN) and indoor residual spraying (IRS) campaigns in several African countries due to concerns around exposure to COVID-19. Suspending such campaigns will leave many vulnerable populations at greater risk of malaria, particularly young children and pregnant women. WHO strongly encourages countries not to suspend the planning for – or implementation of – vector control activities, including ITN and IRS campaigns, while ensuring these services are delivered using best practices to protect health workers and communities from COVID-19 infection. Modifications of planned distribution strategies may be needed to minimize exposure to the coronavirus. The Alliance for Malaria Prevention has provided valuable guidance for national malaria control programmes on the distribution of ITNs in the context of the COVID-19 response; these recommendations are consistent with WHO global guidance.For the implementation of IRS campaigns, WHO supports guidance developed by the U.S. President’s Malaria Initiative in the context of COVID-19. Among other actions, the guidance advises IRS deployment teams to: increase the number of hand washing stations and soap at all operations sites; reinforce morning health checks for all team members, adding temperature checks where feasible; wear N-95 masks and personal protective equipment before entering operations sites; and frequently wipe down any touched surfaces (door handles, vehicle railings, etc). In addition to the above recommendations, basic WHO-recommended protective measures should be provided for the general population."
Should WHO-recommended preventive therapies be maintained in sub-Saharan Africa?,"Yes, delivery of intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy (IPTp), seasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC), and intermittent preventive treatment in infants (IPTi) should be maintained provided that best practices for protecting health workers – and other front-line workers – from COVID-19 are followed. Ensuring access to these and other core malaria prevention tools saves lives and is an important strategy for reducing the strain on health systems in the context of the COVID-19 response.New guidance from WHO describes the rights, roles and responsibilities of health workers in the context of COVID-19. WHO has also developed guidance for countries to safely maintain essential health services during the pandemic."
Are there any changes to WHO guidance with respect to malaria diagnosis and treatment?,WHO guidance remains the same. Early diagnosis and treatment are critical to prevent a mild case of malaria from progressing to severe illness or death. Countries should not scale back efforts to detect and treat malaria; doing so would seriously undermine the health and well-being of millions of people infected with a potentially life-threatening disease.
What additional special measures may be needed in the context of COVID-19?,"In addition to routine approaches to malaria control, there may be a case for special measures in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic – such as a temporary return to presumptive malaria treatment, or the use of mass drug administration – which have proved useful in some previous emergencies. Presumptive malaria treatment refers to treatment of a suspected malaria case without the benefit of diagnostic confirmation (e.g. through a rapid diagnostic test). This approach is typically reserved for extreme circumstances, such as disease in settings where prompt diagnosis is no longer available.Mass drug administration (MDA) is a WHO-recommended approach for rapidly reducing malaria mortality and morbidity during epidemics and in complex emergency settings. Through MDA, all individuals in a targeted population are given antimalarial medicines – often at repeated intervals – regardless of whether or not they show symptoms of the disease. Such special measures should only be adopted after careful consideration of 2 key aims: lowering malaria-related mortality and keeping health workers safe. WHO is exploring concrete proposals for when and how to activate such measures; guidance will be published in due course."
What is physical activity?,"Physical activity includes all forms of active
recreation, sports participation, cycling and walking, as well as activities
you do at work and around the home and garden. It doesn’t have to be exercise
or sport – play, dance, gardening, and even house cleaning and carrying heavy
shopping is all part of being physically active.During the COVID-19 pandemic, when so many of us are
very restricted in our movements, it is even more important for people of all
ages and abilities to be as active as possible. Even a short break from
sitting, by doing 3-5 minutes of physical movement, such as walking or
stretching, will help ease muscle strain, relieve mental tension and improve
blood circulation and muscle activity. Regular physical activity can also help
to give the day a routine and be a way of staying in contact with family and
friends."
Why do we need it?,"Regular physical activity benefits both the body and
mind. It can reduce high blood pressure, help manage weight and reduce the risk
of heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes, and various cancers. It also
improves bone and muscle strength and increases balance, flexibility and
fitness. For older people, activities that improve balance help to prevent
falls and injuries. For children, regular physical activity helps support
healthy growth and development and reduce the risk of disease in later life,
and through regular activity, children can develop fundamental movement skills
and build social relationships.Regular physical activity also improves mental health
and can reduce the risk of depression, cognitive decline and delay the onset of
dementia - and improve overall feelings of wellbeing."
Why is WHO particularly concerned about the spread of COVID-19 in malaria-affected areas?,"Experience from previous disease outbreaks has shown the disruptive effect on health service delivery and the consequences for diseases such as malaria. The 2014-2016 Ebola outbreak in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, for example, undermined malaria control efforts and led to a massive increase in malaria-related illness and death in the 3 countries.In recent weeks, the COVID-19 pandemic has tested the resilience of robust health systems around the world. Recognizing the heavy toll that malaria exacts on vulnerable populations in countries with fragile health systems, WHO underlines the critical importance of sustaining efforts to prevent, detect and treat malaria. In all regions, protective measures should be utilized to minimize the risk of COVID-19 transmission between patients, communities and health providers. WHO has developed detailed guidance for health workers in the context of the COVID-19 outbreak response, as well as operational guidance for safely maintaining essential health services."
What are the key considerations for countries that are working to eliminate malaria or prevent re-establishment of transmission?,"All of the considerations described above apply to malaria-eliminating countries and those preventing re-establishment of the disease: efforts must be sustained to prevent, detect and treat malaria cases while preventing the spread of COVID-19 and ensuring the safety of those who deliver the services. Countries that are nearing malaria elimination must protect their important gains and avoid malaria resurgences. Countries that have eliminated malaria must remain vigilant for any imported cases of malaria that may be occurring to prevent reintroduction of the disease."
Have there been disruptions in the global supply of key malaria-related commodities as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic?,"Yes. In recent days, there have been reports of disruptions in the supply chains of essential malaria commodities – such as long-lasting insecticidal nets, rapid diagnostic tests and antimalarial medicines – resulting from lockdowns and from a suspension of the importation and exportation of goods in response to COVID-19. Coordinated action is required to ensure the availability of key malaria control tools, particularly in countries with a high burden of the disease, and that efforts to limit the spread of COVID-19 do not compromise access to malaria prevention, diagnosis and treatment services."
What is WHO doing to support malaria-affected countries in the context of COVID-19?,"WHO is working across the 3 levels of the Organization (country, region and headquarters) to ensure that any advice intended to prevent the spread of the coronavirus and to guide COVID-19 disease management is appropriate in malaria-affected settings.
            Together with partners, WHO has also identified a set of inter-related actions that are needed to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 in countries where malaria strikes hardest. The Organization recently convened partners to discuss areas
        of collaboration and coordination, with the aim of:
        generating, using and disseminating accurate information; mitigating against health systems disruptions; and ensuring the continuity of routine malaria-specific services while also providing, in some settings, additional special measures.WHO stands ready to work with countries and other stakeholders to mitigate the negative impact of the coronavirus on malaria responses worldwide and, where possible, contribute towards a successful COVID-19 response."
What is WHO’s position on the use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in the context of the COVID-19 response?,"WHO is actively following the ongoing clinical trials that are being conducted in response to COVID-19, including studies looking at the use of chloroquine and its derivative, hydroxychloroquine, for treatment and/or prevention. Currently, there is insufficient data to assess the efficacy of either of these medicines in treating patients with COVID-19, or in preventing them from contracting the coronavirus. Chloroquine is currently recommended by WHO for the treatment of P. vivax malaria. In the context of the COVID-19 response, the dosage and treatment schedules for chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine that are currently under consideration do not reflect those used for treating patients with malaria. The ingestion of high doses of these medicines may be associated with adverse or seriously adverse health outcomes. For public health emergencies, WHO has a systematic and transparent process for research and development (R&D), including for clinical trials of drugs. The WHO “R&D Blueprint” for COVID-19, initiated on 7 January 2020, aims to fast-track the availability of effective tests, vaccines and medicines that can be used to save lives and avert large-scale crises. WHO has also designed a set of procedures to assess the performance, quality and safety of medical technologies during emergency situations."
"How can you clean soiled bedding, towels and linens from patients with COVID-19?","All individuals dealing with soiled bedding, towels and clothes from patients with COVID-19 should: Wear appropriate personal protective equipment, which includes heavy duty gloves, mask, eye protection (face shield/goggles), long-sleeved gown, apron (if gown is not fluid resistant), boots or closed shoes before touching any soiled linen.Never carry soiled linen against body; place soiled linen in a clearly labelled, leak-proof container (e.g. bag, bucket)If there is any solid excrement on the linen, such as feces or vomit, scrape it off carefully with a flat, firm object and put it in the commode or designated toilet/latrine before putting linen in the designated container. If the latrine is not in the same room as the patient, place soiled excrement in covered bucket to dispose of in the toilet or latrine; Wash and disinfect linen: washing by machine with warm water (60-90°C) and laundry detergent is recommended for cleaning and disinfection of linens. If machine washing is not possible, linen can be soaked in hot water and soap in a large drum, using a stick to stir, avoiding splashing. If hot water not available, soak linen in 0.05% chlorine for approximately 30 minutes.  Finally, rinse with clean water and let linen dry fully in the sunlight.  Additional resources for best practices for environmental cleaning can be found in the following two documents: 1) Infection prevention and control of epidemic-and pandemic prone acute respiratory infections in health care2) Best Practices for Environmental Cleaning in Healthcare Facilities in Resource-Limited Settings which was developed by CDC and ICAN in collaboration with WHO"
"What are the recommendation regarding disinfection of vehicles, goods and products coming from China or other COVID-19 affected countries?","To date there is no epidemiological information to suggest
that contact with goods, products or vehicles shipped from COVID-19 affected
countries have been the source of COVID-19 in humans.For these reasons, there is no disinfection recommendations
for any goods and products coming from COVID-19 affected countries given that
there is no available evidence that these products pose a risk to public
health. WHO will continue to closely monitor the evolution of
COVID-19, and will update the recommendations as needed."
What personal protective equipment (PPE) should be used by healthcare workers (HCW) performing nasopharyngeal (NP) or oropharyngeal (OP) swabs on patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19?,"Health care workers collecting NP and OP swab specimens from suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients should be well-trained on the procedure and should wear a clean, non-sterile, long-sleeve gown, a medical mask, eye protection (i.e., googles or face shield), and gloves. Procedure should be conducted in a separate/isolation room, and during NP specimen collection health care workers should request the patients to cover their mouth with a medical mask or tissue. Although collection of NP and OP swabs have the potential to induce fits of coughing from the patient undergoing the procedure, there is no currently available evidence that cough generated via NP/OP specimen collection leads to increased risk of COVID-19 transmission via aerosols."
Should blood centers routinely screen blood products for COVID-19 virus?,"No, although RNA fragments of SARS-CoV-2 were detected in blood of symptomatic COVID-19 patients, this does not mean that the virus is viable/infectious. In general, respiratory viruses are not known to be transmitted by blood transfusion. Blood centers should have routine blood donor screening measures in place to prevent individuals with respiratory symptoms or fever from donating blood.  As precautionary measures, blood centers might encourage self-deferral of those with travel history to an COVID-19 affected country in the previous 14 days, or of those who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 or are close contact with a confirmed COVID-19 case."
How much physical activity is recommended?,"WHO has detailed recommendations on the amount of physical activity people of all ages should do to benefit their health and wellbeing. (available here for children under age of 5 and here for youth, adults and olders) Here are the minimum levels we recommend:Infants under the age of 1 year need to be physically active several times a day.
    Children under 5 years of age should spend at least 180 minutes a day in physical activities, with 3-4 year-olds being moderately or vigorously active for an hour a day.
    Children and adolescents aged 5-17yearsall children and adolescents should do at least 60 minutes a day of moderate to vigorous-intensity physical activity, including activities that strengthen muscle and bone, at least 3 days per week.Adults aged over 18 years should do a total of at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity throughout the week, or at least 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity physical activity throughout the week, including muscle-strengthening activities 2 or more days per
        week.
    older adults with poor mobility should do physical activity to enhance balance and prevent falls on 3 or more days per week.
      But any physical activity is better than none.  Start with small amounts and gradually increase duration, frequency and intensity over time. Being active during the COVID-19 pandemic is challenging for us all.  Because the opportunities to be physically active seem to be more restricted, it is even more important to plan in every day the ways to be active and to reduce the time spent
    sitting for long periods. Put simply, it is a critical time to ensure we all move more and sit less."
So how do I stay safe while exercising in COVID-19?,"Do not exercise if you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing. Stay home and rest, seek medical attention and call in advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority.If you are able to go for a walk or bicycle ride always practice physical distancing and wash your hands with water and soap before you leave, when you get to where you are going, and as soon as you get home.  If water and soap are not immediately available, use alcohol-based hand rub. If you go to a park or public open space to walk, run or exercise always practice physical distancing and wash your hands with water and soap, before you leave, when you get to where you are going, and as soon as you get home.  If water and soap are not immediately available, use alcohol-based hand rub. Follow the directions of your local health authority in regards to any restrictions on the number of people with you and/or restrictions on the use of public outdoor play or exercise equipment. If you are not regularly active start slowly and with low intensity activities, like walking and low impact exercises. Start with shorter amounts, like 5-10 minutes, and gradually build up to 30 minutes or more continuously over a few weeks. It is better and safer to be active for short periods more frequently than to try and be active for long periods when you are not used to it. Choose the right activity so that you reduce the risk of injury and that you enjoy the activity. Choose the right intensity according to your health status and fitness level. You should be able to breath comfortably and hold a conversation while you do light- and moderate-intensity physical activity."
How do I stay active in and around the home?,"Try and reduce long periods of time spent sitting, whether for work, studying, watching TV, reading, or using social media or playing games using screens. Reduce sitting for long periods by taking short 3-5 minute breaks every 20-30 minutes.
    Simply stand up and stretch or even better, take a walk around the house, up and down the stairs, or into the garden. By just moving around and stretching you can improve your health and wellbeing. For more ideas and illustrations of healthy stretches

Learn a new skill – for example try an learn to juggle. Encourage doing some muscle strength training activities such as lifting weights or use improvised weight such as bottles full of water or sand.For Adults Climb up the stairs as much as you can, think of it as an opportunity to be active. Use household chores as a way to be more physical activity. Join in an online exercise class or make up your own routine to music you enjoy that uses the major muscle groups and raises you heart rate. Do some muscle strengthening activities such as lifting weights or improvise using full bottles of water or simply use your own body weight and do sets of press ups, sit ups and squats. Make time for fun, such as dancing to music.Where to get more help and informationFor more ideas use internet search platforms and check out social media for suggestions and access to free resources suitable for children of all ages and adults of all fitness and abilities."
What is Chagas disease?,"Chagas disease, also known as American trypanosomiasis, is a potentially life-threatening illness caused by the protozoan parasite, Trypanosoma cruzi or (T. cruzi).It is found mainly in 21 Latin American countries, where it is mostly vector-borne. The main vector involved in the transmission of the parasite to humans is a triatomine bug, also known as a ‘kissing bug’. An estimated 8 million people are infected worldwide, mostly in Latin America. Chagas disease is clinically curable if treatment is initiated at an early stage. Therefore universal access to prompt diagnosis and care is essential.Once totally confined to the Region of the Americas, Chagas disease has spread to other continents over the last century mainly because of enhanced means of travel and global population movement to and from Latin America.It is estimated that over 10 000 people die every year from clinical manifestations of Chagas disease, and more than 25 million people risk acquiring the disease.Vector control remains the most useful method to prevent infection. Blood screening is vital to avoid infection through transfusion and organ transplantation. Screening and diagnosis in pregnant women and their children are essential control measures.Chagas disease is named after Carlos Justiniano Chagas, a Brazilian doctor, who discovered the disease in 1909."
Who is the vector of Chagas disease?,"The Chagas disease vector is an insect of the Hemiptera order (adults have wings and fly), Reduviidae family and Triatominae subfamily (which feed on blood at all stages of their development) and mainly from the genera Triatoma, Panstrongylus and Rhodnius, but also from 12 other genera.In the Region of the Americas, Chagas disease is transmitted by several species of the triatomine bugs that typically live in the cracks of poorly constructed dwellings in rural areas and suburban slums in Latin America.The bugs hide during the day and emerge at night to feed on human blood, usually when people are asleep. Other infected triatomine bug species may be found in areas surrounding houses and in wild environments. Exchange of infection is therefore possible in such environment.Distribution of vectorsThe distribution of vectors and wild reservoirs of T. cruzi in the Americas extends from the United States of America to Argentina and Chile (latitudes 46°N to 46°S). Triatomine bugs have also been found outside the Region of the Americas, but up to now none of them have been found to be infected.More than 150 species of triatomine bugs and >100 species of mammals, mostly wild species, maintain T. cruzi infection in nature.With such a wide reservoir, Chagas disease is not eradicable.The vector was first described in 1773 by the Swedish scientist Charles De Geer, through the observation of an insect captured in the old so-called ""Indies"" (assumed to refer to the East Indies, probably Indonesia).Triatomine bug species with the capacity to transmit T. cruzi have been identified since the 18th century along maritime travel routes to parts of Africa, the Middle East, South-East Asia and the Western Pacific.Increased global population mobility increased the possibility of establishing vector transmission to areas where Chagas disease was previously non-endemic, especially in Asia, where the vector is naturally abundant, and even infest houses in large numbers."
How is Chagas disease transmitted?,"In the Region of the Americas, T. cruzi is mainly transmitted to humans through the infected faeces of the blood-sucking triatomine bug, which is the disease vector. This insect normally hides during the day and becomes active at night, when it feeds on human blood.In its search for a blood meal, the bug usually bites an exposed area of the skin (such as the face - hence its common English name, “kissing bug”).Right after its blood meal, it defecates close to the bite. The parasite, T.cruzi found in the faeces of the bug, is transmitted when the person rubs the area of the bite in an instinctive reaction to the itch (caused by the bite), thereby putting the faeces in contact with the bite.The parasite can also be transmitted when the parasite comes in contact with the mucous membrane of the eyes or mouth or through any other skin lesion.Transmission can occur through contaminated food infected with the vector’s faecal matter. This frequently generates oral outbreaks, especially in hot and humid climates.Other means of transmission involve transfusion of contaminated blood and from infected mothers to child during pregnancy or during delivery (congenital transmission). Less frequently, organ transplantation or laboratory accident can result in transmission.Outside the Region of the Americas, transmission does not occur through the faeces of the infected vector, but rather through non-vectorial routes.Cases of infection outside Latin America have been reported among travellers returning from endemic regions, adopted children and migrants.Globalisation and increased international travel and trade between endemic and non-endemic countries make Chagas Diseases a growing concern at the global level."
What are the symptoms of Chagas disease?,"Chagas disease has two successive phases: an acute phase and a chronic phase.Most acute phases are asymptomatic or have non-specific symptoms.During the chronic phase patients may also be symptom-free but some may progress to clinical forms of the disease (cardiac, digestive and/or neurological), which can be life threatening if left undiagnosed and untreated.Initial acute phaseThe initial acute phase lasts for about two months after infection. During this phase, a high number of parasites circulate in the blood. In most cases, symptoms are absent or mild, but may include fever, headache, enlarged lymph glands, pallor, muscle pain, cough, difficulty in breathing, liver enlargement , generalized body swelling, diarrhoea, heart inflammation (with chest pain and even heart failure) and, less frequently, meningoencephalitis (with seizures and even paralysis).In less than 50% of people bitten by a triatomine bug, characteristic first visible signs can be a skin lesion (chagoma) or a purplish swelling of the lids of one eye (Romaña sign).The acute phase can occur at any age but is frequently more severe in children aged <2 years, the ederly and in people who are immunosuppressed or in individuals infected with a high number of parasites. Meningoencephalitis is the most frequent manifestion in people suffering from AIDS.Chronic phaseThe acute phase is followed by the chronic phase, during which parasites are hidden mainly in the heart and digestive muscle.Different clinical forms may be observed:the indeterminate form, the most frequent form, asymptomatic and without apparent signs of disease, is typically found immediately after the acute phase and is life-long in most patients;the cardiac form occurs in up to a third of patients, affecting the heart’s electrical conduction system, causing arrhythmia, heart muscle disorder, heart failure and embolisms;the digestive form (generally enlargement of the oesophagus and/or the colon), observed in the South of the Amazon basin, ora mixed form that affects the heart, the digestive system and the autonomic nervous system occurs in ≤15% of patients.Depending on cardiac damage, the mortality rate in a period of 10 years may range from 9 to 85%. Patients usually die, by frequency order, from sudden death caused by arrhythmias, heart failure and vascular cerebral accident, often in early adult life."
"Are boots, impermeable aprons, or coverall suits required as routine personal protective equipment (PE) for healthcare workers (HCW) caring for patients with suspected or confirmed 2019-nCoV infection?","No. Current WHO guidance for HCW caring for suspected or confirmed 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease patients recommends the use of contact and droplet precautions, in addition to standard precautions which should always be used by all HCW for all patients. In terms of PPE, contact and droplet precautions include wearing disposable gloves to protect hands, and clean, non-sterile, long-sleeve gown to protect clothes from contamination, medical masks to protect nose and mouth, and eye protection (e.g., goggles, face shield), before entering the room where suspected or confirmed 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease patients are admitted. Respirators (e.g. N95) are only required for aerosol generating procedures. For more information on PPE for HCW caring for suspected or confirmed nCoV patients, click here."
Can disposable medical face masks be sterilized and reused?,"No. Disposable medical face masks are intended for a single use only. After use they should be removed using appropriate techniques (i.e. do no touch the front, remove by pulling the elastic ear straps or laces from behind) and disposed of immediately in an infectious waste bin with a lid, followed by hand hygiene. For more information on using masks in the context of the nCoV outbreak, click here."
Why does WHO recommend contact and droplet precautions and not routine use of airborne precautions for healthcare workers providing care to patients with suspected/confirmed 2019-nCoV infection?,"WHO developed its rapid guidance based on the consensus of international experts who considered the currently available evidence on the modes of transmission of 2019-nCoV. This evidence demonstrates viral transmission by droplets and contact with contaminated surfaces of equipment; it does not support routine airborne transmission. Airborne transmission may happen, as has been shown with other viral respiratory diseases, during aerosol-generating procedures (e.g., tracheal intubation, bronchoscopy), thus WHO recommends airborne precautions for these procedures. For more information about healthcare worker protection for 2019-nCoV, click here."
Does WHO recommend routine wearing masks for healthy people during the 2019 nCoV outbreak?,"No. WHO does not recommend that asymptomatic individuals (i.e., who do not have respiratory symptoms) in the community should wear medical masks, as currently there is no evidence that routine use of medical masks by healthy individuals prevents 2019-nCoV transmission. Masks are recommended to be used by symptomatic persons in the community. Misuse and overuse of medical masks may cause serious issues of shortage of stocks and lack of mask availability for those who actually need to wear them. 
In health care facilities where health care workers are directly taking care of suspect or confirmed 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease patients, masks are an important part of containing 2019-nCoV spread between people, along with other PPE and hand hygiene. For more information on medical mask use, click here."
Can patients with suspected and confirmed nCoV infection be cohorted in the same room?,"Ideally, suspected and confirmed 2019-nCoV acure respiratory disease patients should be isolated in single rooms. However, when this is not feasible (e.g., limited number of single rooms), cohorting is an acceptable option. Some patients with suspected 2019-nCoV infection may actually have other respiratory illnesses, hence they must be cohorted separately from patients with confirmed 2019-nCoV infection. A minimum of 1-meter distance between beds should be maintained at all times."
Do patients with suspected or confirmed 2019-nCoV need to be hospitalized if they have mild illness?,"No. For patients who have mild illness, e.g., low-grade fever, cough, malaise, rhinorrhoea, sore throat without any warning signs, such as shortness of breath or difficulty in breathing, increased respiratory (i.e. sputum or haemoptysis), gastro-intestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and/or diarrhoea and without changes in mental status, hospitalization may not be required unless there is concern for rapid clinical deterioration. All patients discharged home should be instructed to return to hospital if they develop any worsening of illness. For more information on admission criteria, please click here.
For more information on caring for mildly symptomatic 2019-nCoV patients at home, please click here."
Are specialized or referral hospitals required for patients with suspected or confirmed 2019-nCoV infection when hospitalization is needed?,"No. Current WHO recommendations do not include a requirement for exclusive use of specialized or referral hospitals to treat suspected or confirmed 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease patients. However, countries or local jurisdictions may choose to care for patients at such hospitals if those are deemed the most likely to be able to safely care for patients with suspected or confirmed 2019-nCoV infection or for other clinical reasons (e.g., availability of advanced life support). Regardless, any healthcare facility treating patients with suspected or confirmed 2019-nCoV patients should adhere to the WHO infection prevention and control recommendations for healthcare to protect patients, staff and visitors. Click here for the guidance."
What are the disinfectants recommended for environmental cleaning in healthcare facilities or homes housing patients with suspected or confirmed 2019-nCoV infection?,"Environmental cleaning in healthcare facilities or homes housing patients with suspected or confirmed 2019-nCoV infection should use disinfectants that are active against enveloped viruses, such as 2019-nCoV and other coronaviruses. There are many disinfectants, including commonly used hospital disinfectants, that are active against enveloped viruses. Currently WHO recommendations include the use of:

70% Ethyl alcohol to disinfect reusable dedicated equipment (e.g., thermometers) between uses
Sodium hypochlorite at 0.5% (equivalent 5000ppm) for disinfection of frequently touched surfaces in homes or healthcare facilities

More information about environmental cleaning can be found here."
How long the 2019-nCoV can survive on a dry surface?,"There is currently no data available on stability of 2019-nCoV on surfaces.  Data from laboratory studies on SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have shown that stability in the environment depends on several factors including relative temperature, humidity, and surface type. WHO continues to monitor existing evidence around nCoV and will update when such evidence is available."
Is there a special procedure regarding waste produced by patients with suspected or confirmed 2019-nCoV?,"No. Waste produced during the health care or home care of patients with suspected or confirmed 2019-nCoV infection should be disposed of as infectious waste. For more information on disposing of infectious waste, please click here. Or visit CDC website here."
How is the infection transmitted?,"The infection is transmitted by direct or indirect transfer of eye and nose discharges of infected people, particularly young children who harbour the principal reservoir of infection. These discharges can be spread by particular species of flies.In areas where trachoma is endemic, active (inflammatory) trachoma is common among preschool-aged children, with prevalence rates which can be as high as 60–90%. Infection becomes less frequent and shorter in duration with increasing age.The disease thrives especially in crowded living conditions where there are shortages of water, inadequate sanitation and where numerous eye-seeking flies are present. An individual’s immune system can clear a single episode of infection, but in endemic communities, re-acquisition of the organism occurs frequently."
What is trachoma?,"Trachoma is a disease of the eye and the leading infectious cause of blindness worldwide. It is caused by an obligate intracellular bacterium called Chlamydia trachomatis.After years of repeated infection, the inside of the eyelid can become so severely scarred (trachomatous conjunctival scarring) that it turns inwards and causes the eyelashes to rub against the eyeball (trachomatous trichiasis), resulting in constant pain and light intolerance; this and other alterations of the eye can lead to scarring of the cornea. Left untreated, this condition leads to the formation of irreversible opacities, with resulting visual impairment or blindness. The age at which this occurs depends on several factors including local transmission intensity. In very highly endemic communities, it can occur in childhood, though onset of visual impairment between the ages of 30 and 40 years is more typical."
Where does trachoma occur?,"Trachoma is hyperendemic in many of the poorest and most rural areas of 37 countries of Africa, Central and South America, Asia, Australia and the Middle East.It is responsible for the blindness or visual impairment of about 1.9 million people. It causes about 1.4% of all blindness worldwide.Overall, Africa remains the most affected continent, and the one with the most intensive control efforts. As of 2 January 2020, 13 countries had reported achieving elimination goals. These countries are: Cambodia, China, Gambia, Ghana, Islamic Republic of Iran, Iraq, Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Mexico, Morocco, Myanmar, Nepal, Oman and Togo. Eight of those countries – Cambodia, Islamic Republic of Iran, Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Ghana, Mexico, Morocco, Nepal and Oman – had been validated by WHO as having eliminated trachoma as a public health problem."
How is trachoma diagnosed?,"Trachoma disease is usually clinically diagnosed. People are examined for clinical signs through the use of magnifiers (loupes). In most early stages, infection does not present visible signs of the disease. However, repeated infections cause scarring of the conjunctiva and it is during this phase that infected individuals get the feeling of irritation."
What are the clinical signs and how can trachoma be treated?,"The infection is associated with inflammatory changes in the conjunctiva known as “active trachoma”.The WHO grading system for trachoma classifies the disease in 5 grades, depending on the presence of visible signs of the disease. The treatment involves antibiotics to clear infection and surgery for the most advanced cases. Disease grades and associated treatment are listed below.Trachomatous Inflammation – Follicular (TF) - which mostly requires topical treatment. Trachomatous Inflammation – Intense (TI) - during which topical and systemic treatments are considered.Trachomatous Scarring (TS) - when scars are visible as in the tarsal conjunctiva and which may obscure tarsal blood vessels.Trachomatous Trichiasis (TT) - when an individual is referred for eyelid surgery; andCorneal Opacity - a stage during which a person is irreversibly blind."
How can trachoma be prevented and controled?,"Elimination programmes in endemic countries are being implemented using the WHO-recommended SAFE strategy. This consists of:Surgery to treat the blinding stage (trachomatous trichiasis);Antibiotics to clear infection, particularly mass drug administration of the antibiotic azithromycin, which is donated by the manufacturer to elimination programmes, through the International Trachoma Initiative;Facial cleanliness; andEnvironmental improvement, particularly improving access to water and sanitation.Most endemic countries have agreed to accelerate the implementation of this strategy to achieve elimination targets."
How is Chagas disease diagnosed?,"During the acute phase or during reactivation because of immunosuppression (which can be caused by old age, radiation, chemotherapy or AIDS), diagnosis is made by direct detection of the parasite circulating in the bloodstream. To this end a blood wet smear or a blood concentration technique such as microhaematocrit or Strout technique, must be used.Stained preparations, such as malaria films, detect the parasites when parasitaemia is high (acute phase). In the Amazon Basin, microscopy technicians who diagnose malaria have been trained to detect acute individual cases of Chagas disease and, through them, identify possible foodborne outbreaks.During the chronic phase, when the parasite is hidden in target tissues, diagnosis is made via the detection of antibodies against T. cruzi (serological techniques) using serological tests. Some of the most frequently used techniques are: enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), indirect haemagglutination assay, indirect immunofluorescence assay, western blot and rapid diagnostic tests such as immunochromatography.For strict research purposes, molecular tests (qualitative and quantitative polymerase chain reaction) and parasitological tests (haemoculture and xenodiagnosis – with examination of the faeces of uninfected triatomine bugs that have fed from an infected patient’s blood) may also be used."
What is the treatment against Chagas disease?,"Treatment is urgently indicated for anyone during the acute phase and for those in whom the infection has been reactivated (immunosuppression). In these situations, treatment is almost 100% effective, and the disease can be completely cured.However, efficacy decreases as the duration of the infection lengthens. Moreover, infants are less likely to have adverse events from treatment but this risk increases with age.Treatment is also indicated for infants with congenital infection and for patients during the early chronic phase.Adults, especially those with the indeterminate form of the disease, should be offered treatment, but its potential benefits in preventing or delaying the development of Chagas disease should be weighed against the long duration and frequent adverse events.During the late chronic phase, when cardiac or digestive manifestations may occur, additional lifelong medical treatment and surgery are usually indicated.As described earlier, the two medicines used for treatment are benznidazole, often the first-line treatment in most countries; and, nifurtimox. The main contraindications to treatment are pregnancy and kidney or liver failure. Nifurtimox is contraindicated in patients with a history of psychiatric or neurological disorders.Nifurtimox is free of charge through WHO-Bayer agreement.For ordering, please contact :Albajar Viñas P., Tel.:+41 22 791 1261,albajarvinap@who.int;Jourdan S., Tel.:+41 22 791 2498, jourdans@who.int;Akintunde D., Tel: +41 22 791 1084, akintundea@who.int.Benznidazole is produced by Laboratorio ELEA S.A.C.I.F.yA.,Sanabria 2353, C1417AZE, Ciudad de Buenos Aires,Argentina,Tel.: +54-11-43794300,Neglected Diseases Department,info@elea.com and/or http://www.elea.com/en/contacto"
How to prevent Chagas disease?,"There is no vaccine to prevent Chagas disease.However, the following prevention and control tools are useful depending on the geographical area(s) affected:insecticide spraying of houses and surrounding areas;home improvements to prevent vector infestation (such as plastering walls, and installing concrete floors and corrugated iron roofs);good hygiene practices in food preparation, transportation, storage and consumption;personal preventive measures such as bednets;screening of blood donors;testing of organ, tissue and cell donors and receivers;observance of the standard safety protocols (wearing laboratory coats, gloves, face masks, caps and glasses) for laboratory accidents preventionAdditionally, key tools of congenital transmission control are the screening of infected pregnant women and the early detection of possible infection in neonates (secondary prevention) and their siblings to provide early diagnosis and treatment.The diagnosis of an infected newborn can be made at birth by detecting parasites directly in the umbilical cord or venous blood of the baby or when the infant is aged 8 months by detecting antibodies against T. cruzi.In areas where malaria is also transmitted, a system of surveillance for Chagas disease has been recently implemented. Malaria microscopy technicians have been trained to identify T. cruzi parasites in malaria films and detect acute Chagas disease in individual cases. Through them, possible foodborne outbreaks and active transmission areas for the disease may be also detected and controlled."
Why are Chagas disease diagnosis indexes low?,"The present low diagnosis indexes are strongly related to psychosocial rather than biomedical challenges. Among others, the following are well described determinants:Stigma - Forgotten disease or forgotten population? (Pinto Dias)For a long time, Chagas disease was a strictly found in rural areas, plaguing only certain regions of the countryside, usually characterized by poverty and exclusion.To many, Chagas disease symbolises much more than an illness, almost always associated with poverty in rural areas and impoverished house infested with triatomine bugs.Although the epidemiology of Chagas disease has changed because of migration and globalization, it is still associated with the poverty-stricken hut. Today, the disease is found in cities but the social stigma associated with infection remains strong.The social consequences of stigma can be extremely severe; indeed, infection with T. cruzi can lead to social rejection. Infection can also mean work restriction because its association with poor health and potential difficulties in performing work, and even sudden death, creating a fear of financial losses by employers. For these reasons many people are reluctant to seek screening and medical help, which can lead to more serious complications and further spread of the disease.Emotional Burden of Chagas DiseaseStudies have shown that local communities in endemic countries do not have a clear understanding of Chagas disease. Instead people in rural areas merge preconceptions, forging an overall mixed and incorrect concept of the disease, its origin and consequences.For many, Chagas disease is not necessarily associated with its vector or its symptoms, but more with feelings of despair, fear of death and suffering.This negative approach drastically affects health-seeking behaviour as people develop adaptive behaviours, such as refusing to get screened thereby compromising both treatment and diagnosis.Chagas disease diagnosis in non-endemic countriesGlobalisation has led to a rise in awareness about Chagas disease as an emerging issue in non-endemic regions.However, many practitioners in non-endemic countries still consider Chagas disease to be a tropical illness restricted to Latin America, and this assumption causes many misdiagnoses when presented with cardiomyopathies or other clinical manifestations of the disease.Similarly, patients infected with T.cruzi in non-endemic countries may not be aware of their condition which can lead to further transmission through blood and organs donation, for instance.Training health personnel to facilitate diagnosis and provide medical care can greatly help to mitigate transmission and improve prognosis.Regulatory practices in some countries require people applying for employment to go through a compulsory T.cruzi serology. Although the aim is to protect patients with Chagas disease, this practice has resulted in discrimination against infected individuals., causing instead, hindrance and stigmatization.Lack of understanding and knowledge of the disease, along with incorrect beliefs, are clear obstacles to promoting health-seeking behaviour."
Are there special procedures for the management of bodies of persons who have died from 2019-nCoV?,"No, there are no special procedures for the management of bodies of persons who have died from 2019-nCoV. Authorities and medical facilities should proceed with their existing policies and regulations that guide post-mortem management of persons who died from infectious diseases."
Is there a model for setting up an isolation ward and types and products and health requirements?,A model for setting up an isolation ward is currently under development. PPE specifications for healthcare workers caring for nCoV patients can be found  in the disease commodity package at: https://www.who.int/publications-detail/disease-commodity-package---novel-coronavirus-(ncov)
Can chlorine solutions also be used?,"Chlorine solutions are strongly discouraged as they carry a higher risk of hand irritation and ill health effects from making and diluting chlorine solutions, including eye irritation and respiratory problems. In addition, there is a risk of loss of antimicrobial effect if exposed to sunlight or heat.  Preparing chlorine solutions requires training to reach the correct dose of 0.05% with varying strengths of bleach available in the private sector.  Even if stored at a cool dry place with a lid away from sunlight, they have to be renewed daily.  In comparison simple soapy water solution do not have any of the above-mentioned health risks and complications including loss of antiviral effect due to heat or sunlight.  The antiviral effect of soapy water is due to the oily surface membrane of the COVID-virus that is dissolved by soap, killing the virus."
Are smokers and tobacco users at higher risk of COVID-19 infection?,"Smokers are likely to be more vulnerable to COVID-19 as the act of smoking means that fingers (and possibly contaminated cigarettes) are in contact with lips which increases the possibility of transmission of virus from hand to mouth. Smokers may also already have lung disease or reduced lung capacity which would greatly increase risk of serious illness.Smoking products such as water pipes often involve the sharing of mouth pieces and hoses, which could facilitate the transmission of COVID-19 in communal and social settings.Conditions that increase oxygen needs or reduce the ability of the body to use it properly will put patients at higher risk of serious lung conditions such as pneumonia."
What is a coronavirus?,"Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans.  In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recently discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19."
What is COVID-19?,"COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019."
What are the symptoms of COVID-19?,"The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but don’t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention."
How does COVID-19 spread?,"People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales. These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick. WHO is assessing ongoing research on the ways COVID-19 is spread and will continue to share updated findings.    Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be transmitted through the air?Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air.  See previous answer on “How does COVID-19 spread?”Can CoVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing. The risk of catching COVID-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low. However, many people with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms. This is particularly true at the early stages of the disease. It is therefore possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel ill.  WHO is assessing ongoing research on the period of transmission of COVID-19 and will continue to share updated findings.    Can I catch COVID-19 from the feces of someone with the disease?The risk of catching COVID-19 from the feces of an infected person appears to be low. While initial investigations suggest the virus may be present in feces in some cases, spread through this route is not a main feature of the outbreak. WHO is assessing ongoing research on the ways COVID-19 is spread and will continue to share new findings. Because this is a risk, however, it is another reason to clean hands regularly, after using the bathroom and before eating."
What can I do to protect myself and prevent the spread of disease?,"Protection measures for everyoneStay aware of the latest information on the COVID-19 outbreak, available on the WHO website and through your national and local public health authority. Many countries around the world have seen cases of COVID-19 and several have seen outbreaks. Authorities in China and some other countries have succeeded in slowing or stopping their outbreaks. However, the situation is unpredictable so check regularly for the latest news.You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by taking some simple precautions:Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.Why? Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing.Why? When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease.Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth.Why? Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and can make you sick.Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately.Why? Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene you protect the people around you from viruses such as cold, flu and COVID-19.Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority.Why? National and local authorities will have the most up to date information on the situation in your area. Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other infections.Keep up to date on the      latest COVID-19 hotspots (cities or local areas where COVID-19 is      spreading widely). If possible, avoid traveling to places  – especially if you are an older person      or have diabetes, heart or lung disease.Why? You have a higher chance of catching COVID-19 in one of these areas. Protection measures for persons who are in or have recently visited (past 14 days) areas where COVID-19 is spreadingFollow the guidance      outlined above (Protection      measures for everyone) Self-isolate by staying at home if you begin to feel unwell, even with mild symptoms such as headache, low grade fever (37.3 C or above) and slight runny nose, until you recover. If it is essential for you to have someone bring you supplies or to go out, e.g. to buy food, then wear a mask to avoid infecting other people.Why? Avoiding contact       with others and visits to medical facilities will allow these facilities       to operate more effectively and help protect you and others from possible       COVID-19 and other viruses.If you develop fever, cough      and difficulty breathing, seek medical advice promptly as this may be due      to a respiratory infection or other serious condition. Call in advance and      tell your provider of any recent      travel or contact with travelers.Why? Calling in advance will allow your       health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility.       This will also help to prevent possible spread of COVID-19 and other viruses."
What causes Chagas disease?,Chagas disease is an infectious disease caused by the parasite called Trypanosoma cruzi.
What are the symptoms of Chagas disease?,"After infection, you will experience two phases, consequently: acute and chronic. The acute phase lasts about two months. Symptoms are mostly absent or mild and unspecific.However, less than half of those bitten by a triatomine bug show the first visible signs, such as a skin lesion or a purplish swelling of the lid of one eye. Additionally, some may have fever, headache, enlarged lymph glands, pallor, muscle pain, difficulty in breathing, swelling, and abdominal or chest pain.During the chronic phase, up to 30% of patients suffer from cardiac disorders and up to 10% are affected by digestive conditions (typically enlargement of the oesophagus or colon), neurological or mixed changes.In later years infection can lead to a sudden death due to irregular heartbeat or progressive heart failure caused by the destruction of the heart muscle and its nervous system."
How can Chagas disease be transmitted?,"Chagas disease transmission can happen in different ways, through:  1) vectorial transmission, when the person comes into contact with the stools/urine of infected triatomine bugs, through an opened wound, the mouth or the eyes (not due to their bite); 2) oral transmission through the ingestion of food contaminated by the stools/urine of infected triatomine bugs, typically causing outbreaks of oral transmission;3) congenital transmission from mothers to children, in pregnancy or childbirth; 4) transfusional transmission through blood or blood derivatives from infected donors; 5) organ transplantation transmission through organ or tissue transplants from infected donors; 6) laboratorial transmission in laboratory accidents, especially with the parasite culture and the handling of infected samples.However, it is not transmitted through: - hand shakes - kisses- hugs and - sexual relations.Breastfeeding is not contraindicated."
Where are the Chagas disease cases most frequently detected?,"While most of the affected population lives in Latin America, in the last decades cases have been increasingly detected in the USA, Canada, many European countries and some African, Eastern Mediterranean and Western Pacific countries."
"Currently, where do most people with Chagas disease live in? Rural areas or cities?","Insects transmitting Chagas disease (triatomine bugs, called “kissing bugs”, among many other popular names) are usually in rural or peri-urban areas of Latin America. However, due to urbanization, since the 1980s, infected people mostly live in urban areas."
"To know if I have Chagas disease, which test that I should take?","The following tests are especially recommended:- parasitological tests: in the acute phase (around the first two months of infection);- serological tests: in the chronic phase, to detect antibodies against the parasite."
What is taeniasis and cysticercosis?,"Taeniasis is an intestinal infection caused by 3 species of tapeworm: Taenia solium (pork tapeworm), Taenia saginata (beef tapeworm) and Taenia asiatica. Humans can become infected with T. saginata or T. asiatica when they consume infected beef meat or pig liver tissue, respectively, which has not been adequately cooked, but taeniasis due to T. saginata or T. asiatica has no major impact on human health. Therefore, we refers here to the transmission and health impacts of T. solium only.Infection with T. solium can result in two distinct conditions: taeniasis and cysticercosis. While the adult tapeworm in the human intestine (taeniasis) does not have major health impacts, humans can also develop cysticercosis with tapeworm larvae (cysticerci) in the muscles, skin, eyes and the central nervous system, with possible devastating effects on health. When cysts develop in the brain, the condition is referred to as neurocysticercosis. Symptoms include severe headache, blindness, convulsions and epileptic seizures and can be fatal.Neurocysticercosis is the most frequent preventable cause of epilepsy worldwide, and is estimated to cause 30% of all epilepsy cases in countries where the parasite is endemic."
Where do the diseases occur?,"Reliable, detailed epidemiological data on geographical distribution of T. solium taeniasis/cysticercosis in people and pigs is scarce, but can be estimated based on reported human and porcine cysticercosis cases and known risk factors like water and sanitation indicators, and data on pig production, population and geographic conditions.T. solium taeniasis/cysticercosis mainly affects the health and livelihoods of subsistence farming communities in developing countries of Africa, Asia and Latin America. It is common in areas where animal husbandry practices are such that pigs and cattle come into contact with human faeces. But imported taeniasis can also lead to cases in the population of countries where T. solium is not considered a public health problem."
How is it transmitted?,"Taeniasis is acquired by humans through the inadvertent ingestion of tapeworm larvae (cysticerci) in undercooked pork. Once in the human body, cysticerci develop into adult tapeworms that live in the intestine and release egg-bearing gravid proglottids (segments) which are passed out with faeces.Cysticercosis is acquired when worm proglottids or eggs are ingested and the developing larvae migrate through the body and form cysts in tissues. This is the case in pigs and cattle but it can also affect humans, usually when they swallow T. solium egg-contaminated soil, water or food (mainly vegetables) or through self-infection when hygiene practices, such as hand washing after the toilet, are unsufficient. When the central nervous system is affected by the larvae, the infection is called neurocysticercosis."
What are the symptoms of the diseases?,"Taeniasis is usually characterized by mild and non-specific symptoms. Abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhoea or constipation may arise when the tapeworms become fully developed in the intestine, 6–8 weeks after ingestion of the meat containing cysticerci. These symptoms may continue until the tapeworm dies following treatment, otherwise it may live for years.For T. solium cysticercosis, the incubation period is variable, and infected people may remain asymptomatic for years. In some endemic regions (particularly in Asia), infected people may develop visible or palpable nodules (a small solid bump or node which is solid that can be detected by touch) beneath the skin (subcutaneous). These cysts are generally discovered by the host following spontaneous degeneration of the parasite or after treatment, where an inflammatory reaction may occur.Neurocysticercosis is associated with a variety of signs and symptoms depending on the number, size, stage and location of the pathological changes as well as the host’s immune response and the parasite’s genotype, but it can also be clinically asymptomatic. Symptoms may include chronic headaches, blindness, seizures (epilepsy if they are recurrent), hydrocephalus, meningitis, dementia and symptoms caused by lesions occupying spaces of the central nervous system."
How are taeniasis and cysticercosis diagnosed?,"Improved, simple, cost-effective and rapid diagnostic tools are still needed for use in field conditions to detect T. solium carriers as well as human and porcine cysticercosis cases, and to direct programme planning and monitoring.WHO and partners are addressing the lack of a suitable diagnostic toolbox by developing standards for diagnostic products tailored to the needs in countries and especially field settings."
How are these two diseases treated?,"Taeniasis can be treated with praziquantel (5–10 mg/kg, single-administration) or niclosamide (adults and children over 6 years: 2 g, children aged 2–6 years: 1 g; children under 2 years: 500 mg, single-administration after a light meal followed after 2 hours by a laxative).Currently, clinical management and treatment guidelines for neurocysticercosis are being developed by an expert panel with secretariat in WHO. So far, treatment has to be tailored to the individual case. Treatment of active disease may include surgery and/or long courses with praziquantel and/or albendazole, as well as supporting therapy with corticosteroids and/or anti-epileptic drugs, since the destruction of cysts may lead to an inflammatory response. The dosage and the duration of treatment can vary greatly and depend mainly on the number, size, location and developmental stage of the cysts, their surrounding inflammatory edema, acuteness and severity of clinical symptoms or signs."
How large does a meeting or event need to be in order to be a “mass gathering”?,"High profile international sporting events such as the Olympics or World Cups as well as international religious events such as the Hajj count as mass gatherings. However, lower profile conferences and events can also meet WHO’s definition of a mass gathering. An event counts as a “mass gatherings” if the number of people it brings together is so large that it has the potential to strain the planning and response resources of the health system in the community where it takes place. You need to consider the location and duration of the event as well as the number of participants. For example, if the event takes place over several days in a small island state where the capacity of the health system is quite limited then even an event with just a few thousand participants could place a big strain on the health system and then be considered a “mass gathering” event. Conversely, if the event is held in a big city in a country with a large, well-resourced health system and lasts just a few hours, the event may not constitute a “mass gathering” event."
Does WHO recommend that all international mass gatherings be cancelled because of COVID-19?,"No. As each international mass gathering is different, the factors to consider when determining if the event should be cancelled may also differ. Any decision to change a planned international gathering should be based on a careful assessment of the risks and how they can be managed, and the level of event planning. The assessment should involve all stakeholders in the event, and in particular the health authorities in the country or community where the event is due to take place. These authorities and stakeholders are in the best position to assess the level of stress the event might place on the local health system and emergency services – and whether this level of stress is acceptable in the current situation. It is WHO’s view that all countries with community transmission should seriously consider postponing or reducing mass gatherings that bring people together and have the potential to amplify disease and support the recommended best practice of physical distancing. Any decision will be supported through the use of WHO tools, in particular the Risk Assessment for Mass Gatherings during COVID-19. If movement restrictions and further national measures have been established in the country, the WHO RA does not apply. However, when the process of re-opening/conducting mass gatherings is being considered post movement restrictions, it will be key to ensure any decisions are based on a risk assessment, such as the WHO Mass gatherings COVID-19 risk assessment."
What factors should organizers and health authorities look at when assessing whether the risks are acceptable or not?,"For countries not currently known to be experiencing community transmission of COVID-19, the priority consideration will be whether the planned mass gathering event substantially increases the risk of the virus entering the country and becoming established, as well as the risk for participants to importing infection back to their home country and further increasing global spread. In making this assessment, the organizers and their national or local health authorities should recognize that the risk of imported cases of COVID-19 is naturally linked to international travel. They should also recognize that it is neither realistic or desirable to aim for zero risk. When organizers and health authorities are determining whether to hold a mass gathering, they should determine what is an acceptable risk and what additional measures should be implemented to mitigate the risks.For countries where COVID-19 has already started to spread in the community, key consideration will be: aiming at containing or at least slowing down the spread of the virus in the local community/country.preventing participants from other countries being infected with COVID-19  In each case the risk should be considered in the context of the known features of COVID-19, its severity, its transmissibility and the effectiveness of measures to prevent or reduce transmission. The strain already placed on the local health system in responding to COVID-19 outbreak(s), and the additional strain the mass gathering might place on the system also need to be taken into account.You can find more advice on what to look at in the WHO document Key planning recommendations for Mass Gatherings in the context of the current COVID-19 outbreak of 14 February 2020. See: https://www.who.int/publications-detail/key-planning-recommendations-for-mass-gatherings-in-the-context-of-the-current-covid-19-outbreak"
What if my organization does not have the expertise to assess the risks COVID-19 poses for our planned mass gathering?,The national and local public health authorities in the country where you plan to hold the mass gathering will most likely know how to conduct a health risk assessment. If there is a WHO Country Office there they may also be able to provide some expert support. So too might the WHO Regional Office in your part of the world. You can find the names and contact details of the WHO Regional Offices at https://www.who.int/about/who-we-are/regional-offices
"If we go ahead with an international mass gathering, what can we do to reduce the risk of participants catching COVID-19?","Promote hand washing, respiratory hygiene and social distancing at the event. Make sure you have emergency contact details for all participants, including where they are staying during the event. You should make it clear to them that this information will be shared with the local public health authorities to enable rapid contact tracing if a participant at the event becomes ill with COVID-19. The event organisers need to have an agreed preparedness plan in case one or more participants become ill with COVID-19 symptoms. This should include rapid isolation of the ill person and their safe transfer to a local health facility. You should consider whether the number of participants at the event could be reduced, making available participation by video or teleconference and possibly screening participants for COVID-19 symptoms (cough, fever, malaise) at points of entry to the venue. You can find advice on how individual participants can protect themselves and their loved ones from COVID-19 at: https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public"
Where can I find more advice on assessing and managing health risks around international mass gatherings?,"WHO has produced guidance and also a training course on how to plan for a mass gathering. The guidance and the course both look at how to conduct a risk assessment, plan for and manage health risks in partnership with the local authorities: https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/points-of-entry-and-mass-gatherings  You can find advice to give individual participants on how to protect themselves and their loved ones from COVID-19 at: https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public"
How likely am I to catch COVID-19?,"The risk depends on where you  are - and more specifically, whether there is a COVID-19 outbreak unfolding there. For most people in most locations the risk of catching COVID-19 is still low. However, there are now places around the world (cities or areas) where the disease is spreading. For people living in, or visiting, these areas the risk of catching COVID-19 is higher. Governments and health authorities are taking vigorous action every time a new case of COVID-19 is identified. Be sure to comply with any local restrictions on travel, movement or large gatherings. Cooperating with disease control efforts will reduce your risk of catching or spreading COVID-19.COVID-19 outbreaks can be contained and transmission stopped, as has been shown in China and some other countries. Unfortunately, new outbreaks can emerge rapidly. It’s important to be aware of the situation where you are or intend to go. WHO publishes daily updates on the COVID-19 situation worldwide. You can see these at https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports/"
Should I worry about COVID-19?,"Illness due to COVID-19 infection is generally mild, especially for children and young adults. However, it can cause serious illness: about 1 in every 5 people who catch it need hospital care. It is therefore quite normal for people to worry about how the COVID-19 outbreak will affect them and their loved ones. We can channel our concerns into actions to protect ourselves, our loved ones and our communities. First and foremost among these actions is regular and thorough hand-washing and good respiratory hygiene. Secondly, keep informed and follow the advice of the local health authorities including any restrictions put in place on travel, movement and gatherings. Learn more about how to protect yourself at https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public"
Who is at risk of developing severe illness?,"While we are still learning about how COVID-2019 affects people, older persons and persons with pre-existing medical conditions (such as high blood pressure, heart disease, lung disease, cancer or diabetes)  appear to develop serious illness more often than others."
Are antibiotics effective in preventing or treating the COVID-19?,"No. Antibiotics do not work against viruses, they only work on bacterial infections. COVID-19 is caused by a virus, so antibiotics do not work. Antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment of COVID-19. They should only be used as directed by a physician to treat a bacterial infection."
Are there any medicines or therapies that can prevent or cure COVID-19?,"While some western, traditional or home remedies may provide comfort and alleviate symptoms of COVID-19, there is no evidence that current medicine can prevent or cure the disease. WHO does not recommend self-medication with any medicines, including antibiotics, as a prevention or cure for COVID-19. However, there are several ongoing clinical trials that include both western and traditional medicines. WHO will continue to provide updated information as soon as clinical findings are available."
"Is there a vaccine, drug or treatment for COVID-19?","Not yet. To date, there is no vaccine and no specific antiviral medicine to prevent or treat COVID-2019. However, those affected should receive care to relieve symptoms. People with serious illness should be hospitalized. Most patients recover thanks to supportive care. Possible vaccines and some specific drug treatments are under investigation. They are being tested through clinical trials. WHO is coordinating efforts to develop vaccines and medicines to prevent and treat COVID-19. The most effective ways to protect yourself and others against COVID-19 are to frequently clean your hands, cover your cough with the bend of elbow or tissue, and maintain a distance of at least 1 meter (3 feet) from people who are coughing or sneezing. (See Basic protective measures against the new coronavirus)."
Is COVID-19 the same as SARS?,"No. The virus that causes COVID-19 and the one that caused the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003 are related to each other genetically, but the diseases they cause are quite different. SARS was more deadly but much less infectious than COVID-19. There have been no outbreaks of SARS anywhere in the world since 2003."
Should I wear a mask to protect myself?,"Only wear a mask if you are ill with COVID-19 symptoms (especially coughing) or looking after someone who may have COVID-19. Disposable face mask can only be used once. If you are not ill or looking after someone who is ill then you are wasting a mask. There is a world-wide shortage of masks, so WHO urges people to use masks wisely.WHO advises rational use of medical masks to avoid unnecessary wastage of precious resources and mis-use of masks  (see Advice on the use of masks). The most effective ways to protect yourself and others against COVID-19 are to frequently clean your hands, cover your cough with the bend of elbow or tissue and maintain a distance of at least 1 meter (3 feet) from people who are coughing or sneezing. See  basic protective measures against the new coronavirus for more information."
"How to put on, use, take off and dispose of a mask?","Remember, a mask should only be used by health workers, care takers, and individuals with respiratory symptoms, such as fever and cough.Before touching the mask, clean hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or soap and waterTake the mask and inspect it for tears or holes.Orient which side is the top side (where the metal strip is).Ensure the proper side of the mask faces outwards (the coloured side).Place the mask to your face. Pinch the metal strip or stiff edge of the mask so it moulds to the shape of your nose.Pull down the mask’s bottom so it covers your mouth and your chin.After use, take off the mask; remove the elastic loops from behind the ears while keeping the mask away from your face and clothes, to avoid touching potentially contaminated surfaces of the mask. Discard the mask in a closed bin immediately after use.Perform hand hygiene after touching or discarding the mask – Use alcohol-based hand rub or, if visibly soiled, wash your hands with soap and water."
How long is the incubation period for COVID-19?,"The “incubation period” means the time between catching the virus and beginning to have symptoms of the disease. Most estimates of the incubation period for COVID-19 range from 1-14 days, most commonly around five days. These estimates will be updated as more data become available."
Is there any effective treatment for Chagas disease?,"Treatment for Chagas disease ranges from eliminating the parasite T. cruzi to dealing with clinical manifestations and complications, including psychological, familial, labor and social security support."
What should be the criteria for excluding an athlete or other accredited participant from competing?,"Agreed health criteria are needed for the exclusion of athletes from competing and for allowing them to return to competition wherever appropriate. These should be consistent with public health guidelines for the general population, with risk profiles based on recent travel to high-risk community transmission zones, recent contact with individuals diagnosed with or suspected of having COVID-19, current symptomatology, etc. Athletes who are feeling unwell should not participate in events.If testing of athletes has been agreed with the local public health service there is a need to consider test availability, time taken for receipt of test results and host-country health services capacity. Criteria for exclusion of officials/judges from competition and for allowing them to return to competition where appropriate should follow guidance and criteria for the workplace.Requirements for the attendance of all athletes and other accredited participants should be put in place:–   health check: travel declaration and temperature screening–   contact tracing protocols ready (with all details of those present) –   allowing extra spacing (physical distancing)–   following all hygiene precautions.  Isolation procedures for athletes and other accredited participants (e.g. field-of-play staff, medical teams, officials who have close contact with the athletes) who feel unwell or become symptomatic should be clear and documented and rehearsed prior to holding the event, especially for higher risk sports, e.g. contact sports."
Should event organizers arrange screening at venues beyond national government requirements for point of entry (PoE)?,"Temperature screening alone, at exit or entry, is not an effective way to stop international spread, since infected individuals may be in incubation period, may not express apparent symptoms early on in the course of the disease, or may dissimulate fever through the use of antipyretics; in addition, such measures require substantial investments for what may bear little benefits. It is more effective to provide prevention recommendation messages to travellers and to collect health declarations at arrival, with travellers’ contact details, to allow for a proper risk assessment and a possible contact tracing of incoming travellers. Event organizers should also consider the capacity to undertake this and the management of suspected cases. However, sporting organizations may have criteria for participation that are stricter than government requirements for Ports of Entry into the country that are based on event risk assessment, including organizers' healthcare capacity.Any additional screening questionnaires for participation in events need to be aligned with public health agencies in the jurisdiction. There is a need to consider how to manage different groups – athletes, officials and spectators, and the large numbers of individuals likely to arrive at a sporting event from many oversea countries – and to follow both host country and WHO travel advice and to assess whether there is difficulty in obtaining accurate information about the travel history of those individuals."
Should event organizers provide COVID-19 testing?,"No, testing should be conducted in accordance with local health providers and national guidance.  Anyone unwell or symptomatic should not be allowed to participate in the event. Establish close collaboration with local public health authorities well before the event, to facilitate testing for athletes, officials or spectators who meet pre-agreed suspect cases definitions. Consider host-country health service capacity to manage any COVID-19 activity, and other public health issues happening at the event over and above its own national pandemic response."
Are there additional safeguards event organizers can implement or recommend to athletes/officials/visitors in the context of COVID-19?,"Follow standard preventative advice to the general public, including physical distancing, in the athletes’ village.Also promote:signage, digital messaging to all participants and their entourages about COVID-19 and how to prevent infectionregular disinfection and cleaning of surfaces, in venues and in personal spaces non-sharing of equipment and cleaning of equipment after each user.Organizers are recommended to develop a checklist (include hand gels stations, hygiene facilities, etc.). See the event mitigation recommendations checklist for event organizers above."
What are the risks arising from public transport to the venue(s)?,The extra risk from participants and spectators travelling on public transport in a major city may not be significant compared to the ongoing risk to the local population using the transport all the time if physical distancing is not possible on public transport.
Is contraception/ family planning safe to use during the COVID-19 pandemic?,"Yes. All modern methods of contraception are safe to use, including during the COVID-19 pandemic.  


If you have had a baby in the last six months or have a health condition, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or breast cancer – or if you smoke – seek advice from a health care professional to ensure you are using a method of contraception which is suitable and safe for you."
I want to avoid getting pregnant during the COVID-19 pandemic. What can I do?,"If you do not want to become pregnant, you should start or continue to use your contraceptive method of choice. You may be able to access information and contraceptive services from a healthcare provider by phone or online.  


If you cannot access these services you may opt for a method that is available without a prescription (such as condoms, spermicides, diaphragm, pills, or emergency contraceptive pills) from a nearby pharmacy or drug shop."
I can’t access my contraceptive method of choice. What do you advise?,"If you cannot access your contraceptive method of choice – perhaps because it requires a prescription, or because it can only be given to you by a health worker – consider using condoms, fertility awareness-based methods, lactational amenorrhea (if you are exclusively breastfeeding), or other contraceptive methods that are recommended for self-care in your country.  


Depending on the situation in your country, methods recommended for self-care could include the pill or mini-pill, emergency contraception pills, and DMPA-SC (Sayana Press®)."
What is the best contraceptive method to use during the COVID-19 pandemic?,"All modern methods of contraception help to prevent pregnancy. Women and their partners can choose any modern contraceptive method that is acceptable to and safe for them. The best method of contraception is the one that works well for you.
There is a wide variety of modern methods, one of which may suit you best. For more information see here. 
Condoms, when they are used consistently and correctly, are the only method of contraception that help to prevent unintended pregnancy and protect against sexually transmitted infections, including HIV.  They can be used together with other methods of contraception to protect against both unintended pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections.
Emergency contraceptive pills can prevent up to 95% of pregnancies when taken within 5 days after intercourse, and they can be taken by anyone with or without a health condition"
I want to change my contraceptive method – is this possible?,"Yes. It may be difficult however, to access all the methods of contraception that are normally available in your country due to restrictions on movement, lack of supply, as well as increased demands on health providers and services.  


If you have a pre-existing health condition, consult a provider to find out what options suit you best, and which are available and feasible. Seek advice and information from your health provider and consider using methods that do not have medical restrictions like minipills, condoms, fertility awareness-based methods, diaphragm, spermicides or lactational amenorrhea if you are exclusively breastfeeding."
I want to remove or replace my implant or IUD – can I do this during COVID-19 pandemic?,"Removal of long acting methods such as implants or IUDs, after the recommended period of use (and routine follow up appointments) may not be prioritized by your country’s health system during this health emergency. Seek advice from your health provider. 


If, due to restrictions on movement due to the COVID-19 pandemic you cannot have your long acting method removed straight away, it is important to use another method of contraception to avoid pregnancy at this time.   


There are no medical problems caused by delaying removal of long acting methods such as implants or IUDs. Do not try to remove the contraception method yourself; wait until you are able to access health care from a trained provider."
Can humans become infected with the COVID-19 from an animal source?,"Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in animals. Occasionally, people get infected with these viruses which may then spread to other people. For example, SARS-CoV was associated with civet cats and MERS-CoV is transmitted by dromedary camels. Possible animal sources of COVID-19 have not yet been confirmed.  To protect yourself, such as when visiting live animal markets, avoid direct contact with animals and surfaces in contact with animals. Ensure good food safety practices at all times. Handle raw meat, milk or animal organs with care to avoid contamination of uncooked foods and avoid consuming raw or undercooked animal products."
Can I catch COVID-19 from my pet?,"We are aware of instances of animals and pets of      COVID-19 patients being infected with the disease;As the intergovernmental body responsible for improving animal health      worldwide, the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) has been developing technical      guidance on specialised topics related to animal health, dedicated to      veterinary services and technical experts (including on testing and      quarantine);There is a possibility for some animals to become      infected through close contact with infected humans. Further evidence is      needed to understand if animals and pets can spread the      disease;Based on current evidence, human to human transmission remains      the main driver;It is still too early to say whether cats could be the      intermediate host in the transmission of the COVID-19."
How long does the virus survive on surfaces?,"It is not certain how long the virus that causes COVID-19 survives on surfaces, but it seems to behave like other coronaviruses. Studies suggest that coronaviruses (including preliminary information on the COVID-19 virus) may persist on surfaces for a few hours or up to several days. This may vary under different conditions (e.g. type of surface, temperature or humidity of the environment).If you think a surface may be infected, clean it with simple disinfectant to kill the virus and protect yourself and others. Clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Avoid touching your eyes, mouth, or nose."
Is it safe to receive a package from any area where COVID-19 has been reported?,"Yes. The likelihood of an infected person contaminating commercial goods is low and the risk of catching the virus that causes COVID-19 from a package that has been moved, travelled, and exposed to different conditions and temperature is also low."
Is there anything I should not do?,"The following measures ARE NOT effective against COVID-2019 and can be harmful:SmokingWearing multiple masksTaking antibiotics (See question 10 ""Are there any medicines of therapies that can prevent or cure COVID-19?"")In any case, if you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing seek medical care early to reduce the risk of developing a more severe infection and be sure to share your recent travel history with your health care provider."
Is the source of the coronavirus causing COVID-19 known?,"Currently, the source of SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus (CoV) causing COVID-19 is unknown. All available evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 has a natural animal origin and is not a constructed virus. SARS-CoV-2 virus most probably has its ecological reservoir in bats. SARS-CoV-2, belongs to a group of genetically related viruses, which also include SARS-CoV and a number of other CoVs isolated from bats populations. MERS-CoV also belongs to this group, but is less closely related."
How did the first human SARS-CoV-2 infections occur?,"The first human cases of COVID-19 were identified in Wuhan City, China in December 2019. At this stage, it is not possible to determine precisely how humans in China were initially infected with SARS-CoV-2.However, SARS-CoV, the virus which caused the SARS outbreak in 2003, jumped from an animal reservoir (civet cats, a farmed wild animal) to humans and then spread between humans. In a similar way, it is thought that SARS-CoV-2 jumped the species barrier and initially infected humans, but more likely through an intermediate host, that is another animal species more likely to be handled by humans - this could be a domestic animal, a wild animal, or a domesticated wild animal and, as of yet, has not been identified.Until the source of this virus is identified and controlled, there is a risk of reintroduction of the virus in the human population and the risk of new outbreaks like the ones we are currently experiencing."
Can COVID-19 be spread through coins and banknotes?,"There is currently no evidence to confirm or disprove that COVID-19 virus can be transmitted through coins or banknotes. However, respiratory droplets expelled from an infected person can contaminate and persist on surfaces. Wash your hands regularly and thoroughly after touching any frequently-touched surface or object, including coins or banknotes. Avoid touching your eyes, mouth and nose, if your hands are not cleaned."
How can I grocery shop safely in the time of COVID-19?,"When grocery shopping, keep at least 1-metre distance from others and avoid touching your eyes, mouth and nose. If possible, sanitize the handles of shopping trolleys or baskets before shopping. Once home, wash your hands thoroughly and also after handling and storing your purchased products. There is currently no confirmed case of COVID-19 transmitted through food or food packaging."
How to wash fruits and vegetables in the time of COVID-19?,"Fruits and vegetables are essential components of a healthy diet. Wash them the same way you would in any other circumstance. Before handling them, wash your hands with soap and water. Then, wash fruits and vegetables thoroughly with clean water, especially if you eat them raw."
Is COVID-19 airborne?,"The virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through droplets generated when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or speaks. These droplets are too heavy to hang in the air. They quickly fall on floors or surfaces. You can be infected by breathing in the virus if you are within 1 metre of a person who has COVID-19, or by touching a contaminated surface and then touching your eyes, nose or mouth before washing your hands."
What is malnutrition?,"Malnutrition refers to deficiencies, excesses or imbalances in a person’s intake of energy and/or nutrients. The term malnutrition covers 2 broad groups of conditions. One is ‘undernutrition’—which includes stunting (low height for age), wasting (low weight for height), underweight (low weight for age) and micronutrient deficiencies or insufficiencies (a lack of important vitamins and minerals). The other is overweight, obesity and diet-related noncommunicable diseases (such as heart disease, stroke, diabetes and cancer).


At a health centre in South Sudan a health workers helps a mother  weigh her child to check on the child’s nutrition levels."
What are the consequences of malnutrition?,"Malnutrition affects people in every country. Around 1.9 billion adults worldwide are overweight, while 462 million are underweight. An estimated 41 million children under the age of 5 years are overweight or obese, while some 159 million are stunted and 50 million are wasted. Adding to this burden are the 528 million or 29% of women of reproductive age around the world affected by anaemia, for which approximately half would be amenable to iron supplementation.
Many families cannot afford or access enough nutritious foods like fresh fruit and vegetables, legumes, meat and milk, while foods and drinks high in fat, sugar and salt are cheaper and more readily available, leading to a rapid rise in the number of children and adults who are overweight and obese, in poor as well as rich countries. It is quite common to find undernutrition and overweight within the same community, household or even individual – it is possible to be both overweight and micronutrient deficient, for example."
What is being done to address malnutrition?,"In April 2016, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution proclaiming the UN Decade of Action on Nutrition from 2016 to 2025. The Decade aims to catalyse policy commitments that result in measurable action to address all forms of malnutrition. The aim is to ensure all people have access to healthier and more sustainable diets to eradicate all forms of malnutrition worldwide."
What are soil-transmitted helminths (STH)?,"Helminth is a technical name for worm.There are 3 species of STH which are particularly critical in terms of public health: Roundworm, Whipworm and Hookworm."
How do I get soil-transmitted helminths (STH)?,"A person who is infected with STH has parasite eggs in their faeces.In areas where there is no proper latrine system, the soil around the village or living area becomes contaminated with faeces containing these worm eggs.In the soil the eggs mature: this takes from between 2 and 4 weeks. They can then infect humans in two ways:eggs stick to vegetables grown in the area. If the vegetables are not carefully cooked, washed or peeled, the eggs are ingested and infect the person;young children often play in the soil and put their hands in their mouths without washing them. In this way they ingest the eggs and become infected.You can also become infected by:drinking unclean water which has STH eggs in it;>walking barefoot on contaminated soil. The eggs hatch into larvae which can penetrate the skin of people walking barefoot (this is only true for hookworms)."
How do I avoid getting (STH)?,"Drink clean water and wash, cook or peel food carefully before eating it.

Wash your hands before eating.Wear shoes."
What are the symptoms of STH?,"Most of the symptoms of STH infections are very nonspecific and 
only become evident when the infection is particularly severe. The 
nonspecific symptoms include nausea, tiredness, abdominal pain and loss 
of appetite.Sometimes you will see worms in your faeces."
What are the health problems caused by STH?,"Anaemia: Hookworms live in the intestine. They attach 
themselves to the intestine wall and feed on blood from the cut vessels 
and mucosal tissues. This blood loss causes anaemia.Vitamin A deficiency: Worms need vitamin A to live. In 
many countries, people do not eat enough vitamin A-rich foods. In these 
situations, the limited amount of vitamin A that is eaten is taken by 
the worms.Learning: Worm infected children are less able to concentrate or memorize information. They score less well in school tests.Intestinal obstruction: If a person is constantly infected
 over a long period of time, the number of worms in that person's 
intestine steadily increases. Eventually the number of worms can become 
so great that they block the intestine and the only option at that stage
 is surgery. This is usually the case for small children whose 
intestines are still relatively narrow."
"If I think I have STH, how do I treat them?","Treatment is very simple and safe.Take one dose of any of the following four drugs.If you live in an area where worms are a problem, it is a good idea to treat yourself regularly (e.g twice a year).  
 Dose by age 1−2 years2 years upwardsAlbendazole (400 mg tablet)1/2 tablet1 tabletMebendazole (500 mg tablet)1 tablet

 Dose by age 1−5 years1−12 years12 years upwardsLevamisole (40 mg tablet)2.5mg/kg2 tablets2.5mg/kgPyrantel (250 mg tablet)10mg/kg"
Home is not a safe place for me. What can I do?,"If you are experiencing violence, it may be helpful to reach out to family, friends and neighbors, to seek support from a hotline or, if safe, from online service for survivors of violence. Find out if local services (e.g. shelters, counselling) are open and reach out to them if available. Make a safety plan in case the violence against you or your children escalates. This includes: Identifying a neighbour, friend, relative, colleague, or shelter to go to in case you need to leave the house immediately for safety. Have a plan for how you will exit the house safely and how you will reach there (e.g. transport).  Keep a few essential items (e.g. identification documents, phone, money, medicines, and clothes) available, and a list of telephone numbers in case of an emergency.  If possible, develop a code with a trusted neighbour so they can come to your aid in case of an emergency."
I need medical attention because of violence. Who can help me and where should I go?,"If you need urgent medical attention, call for an ambulance or contact your country’s emergency health services. If you need any other support, contact a specialized service if available or a health provider."
"I am safe, but I am suffering from mental / sexual / social / long-term physical health problems because of violence. Is there anyone who can help me during COVID-19?","As much as possible, reduce sources of stress: Maintain contact with and seek support from family and friends via phone, email, text, etc. Try to maintain daily routines and make time for physical activity and sleep. Use relaxation exercises (e.g. slow breathing, meditation, progressive muscle relaxation, grounding exercises – see WHO Clinical handbook p.70) to relieve stressful thoughts and feelings. Engage in activities that in the past have helped with managing adversity. Seek information about COVID- 19 from reliable sources and reduce the time spent consuming news (for example, 1-2 times per day, rather than every hour). Seek care from a trained health provider for symptoms and conditions including injuries that need medical attention. Due to restrictions on movement, and pressure on health systems, it may be difficult to access healthcare in person at this time. In this case, find out what is available in your locality and seek alternatives, including information and support offered by phone or online.  If you are currently receiving healthcare and support for violence-related issues this could continue during COVID-19 – this could even be by phone or online if feasible and appropriate for your health needs."
I am worried about someone I know. How can I help?,"If you know of, or are concerned about, someone in an abusive relationship there are some things you can do: Keep regularly in touch with the person to check that they are safe, ensuring that it is safe for them to be in touch with you. Assume that a perpetrator of violence can see, hear and or monitor communications, so find out how best to communicate with the person that you are concerned about.  Send them an SMS or message via email or social media, in a way that is safe for them. Be discrete in connecting with them when the abuser is present in the home so that they are not placed at risk of additional harm. Check each time, as this may change. Find out what services for survivors of violence against women (e.g. shelters, hotlines, counselling services, women’s organizations) are functioning during the COVID-19 pandemic and make this information available through your networks and social media. Only provide this information directly if you can do so discretely without the abuser finding out.  If someone you know needs urgent help for whatever reason, be prepared to call emergency health services, the police, health centre, or hotline."
I want to report an incidence of violence during COVID-19. What should I do?,"If you want to report an incidence of violence, you should follow your country’s guidance on how to report violence and contact the service where you are most likely to get a survivor-centred response.  Some countries are making exceptions to movement restrictions for reporting of violence specifically. Remember that reporting may put you at risk, so ensure you have a safety plan in place. You may find making a report mentally or emotionally difficult. Seek the support of friends, relations, neighbours or colleagues, or local support services for survivors of violence."
"Why is providing contraception/ family planning, as well as family planning services and information, important during the COVID-19 pandemic?","Contraception and family planning information and services are life-saving and important at all times. Sexual activity does not cease with the COVID-19 pandemic, it is therefore crucial to ensure that people are able to access rights-based services and information to initiate and / or continue use of contraception. By preventing unintended pregnancies, contraception helps to protect girls and women from the negative health consequences of unintended pregnancies, which can save their lives. Contraception reduces the need for abortion, meaning that women and girls are less at risk of unsafe abortion, which again can be lifesaving.  Condoms, when used consistently and correctly, help to prevent both unintended pregnancies and sexually transmitted infections (including HIV).  In addition, by preventing the negative health consequences associated with unintended pregnancies, unsafe abortion and sexually transmitted infections (including HIV), contraception can help alleviate unnecessary additional pressure on already-stretched health systems which are working hard to address COVID-19."
I am a policy maker. What can I do to make sure people can access contraception and family planning information and services?,"Plan and develop innovative strategies to ensure as many eligible people as possible can access information and contraception during this period. 


Increase use of mobile phones and digital technologies to help people make decisions about which contraceptive methods to use, and how they can be accessed.  


Enable health care workers to provide contraceptive information and services as per national guidelines to the full extent possible.  This is particularly important where pregnancy poses a high risk to health.   


Expand availability of contraceptive services (including both information and methods) through places other than healthcare facilities, such as pharmacies, drug shops, online platforms and other outlets.  This can be with or without prescription depending on national guidelines and contraceptive method.   


Relax restrictions on the number of repeat issues of prescription-only hormonal contraceptives that can be issued. 


Ensure access to emergency post-coital contraception, including consideration of over the counter provision. 


Enable access to contraception for women and girls in the immediate post-partum and post abortion periods when they may access health services."
I am a programme manager. What can I do to help people access contraception and family planning information and services?,"Increase use of telehealth for counselling and sharing of messages related to safe and effective use of contraception and for selection and initiation of contraceptives. 


Ensure adequate inventory to avoid potential stock outs at all levels of the health system. 


Prepare advisories for users on how they can access contraceptive information, services and supplies. 


Monitor contraceptive consumption in your area to identify any potential pitfall and shortage.


Increase availability and access to the contraceptives which can be used by the client without service provider support."
"If I am pregnant, is it safe to take the drugs?","Yes, the drugs are safe and WHO recommends that if you have worms, you should be treated, even if you are pregnant.As a general precaution, WHO recommendations state that all drugs should be taken after the first trimester"
"I am going on holiday to a country where I think worms are a problem, should I be concerned ?","First, you can easily avoid getting schistosomiasis by not swimming in fresh water in areas where schistosomiasis is likely to occur.Second, worms (both schistosomes and soil-transmitted helminths 
(STHs) do not cause a life-threatening disease for someone who is 
generally healthy and then becomes infected. The disease is only serious
 for people living in endemic areas who become constantly reinfected and
 have no access treatment.Third, if you get infected, the treatment is easy and safe."
I have harmed or am worried about harming or hurting my partner (and children) with my words or actions. How can I stop?,"If you feel yourself getting angry or very annoyed, step away into another room if you can, or outside for a deep breath.  Count to ten and breathe in and out until you feel calmer. Count down from 10, or do anything else that may help you stay calm. Talk to a trusted friend, relative, or religious leader and if necessary seek help from local health services or specialized services if available.  Recognize that everyone in your family is experiencing stress during this time. Demonstrate kindness and patience in your words and actions.  Eliminate or reduce your alcohol consumption as much as possible. The current measures to address the COVID-19 pandemic, such as restrictions on movement, as well as financial instability caused by the crisis, are likely to add to your stress.  This is normal, and you can control how you react.  Take measures to ensure you manage your stress in a way that is respectful and safe to you and your family. Try to be kind to yourself, your partner, children and anyone else in the family."
I am a health worker. How can I help women survivors of violence during COVID-19?,"As a health worker, there are things you can do to help mitigate the impacts of violence on women and children at any time, including during the COVID-19 pandemic.   Whilst your time and resources may be stretched during this health emergency, you have a duty of care to women who may seek help from you – often to address physical and mental hurt caused by violence.   You may need to adjust how you deliver services, if face-to-face care is not possible. Depending on your resources consider mobile phone, WhatsApp or other communication channels to deliver support, always ensuring you can do this in a way that is safe for the survivor. Communicate openly with women about any changes in service delivery.   If a woman with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 seeks your care because of violence, your response should be the same as for any other survivor. You should however ensure that you are protected from infection, by maintaining distance where possible, wearing protective clothing, practicing respiratory hygiene, and washing hands and surfaces with soap and water regularly and after touching, to avoid infection. In any circumstances, including during the COVID-19 pandemic, health workers should provide first-line supporting, using the LIVES approach to help women survivors of violence:  Listen closely, with empathy and no judgement Inquire about women’s needs and concerns Validate women’s experiences. Show you believe and understand. Enhance their safety. Support women to connect with additional services."
I run a health facility. What can I do to support women survivors of violence during COVID-19?,"Identify information on local services for survivors, including on hotlines, shelters, rape crisis centers, and counselling.  Find out opening hours, contact details and whether these services can be offered remotely, and establish referral linkages.  Make these available to health care providers and easily accessible to patients/clients coming to your facility.  Support the health care providers in your facility to continue to support women survivors of violence during this time. Be prepared to shift rapidly to providing care through alternative ways, by creating effective response plans; for example, by ensuring frontline healthcare workers have phones and can charge them.  Ensure there is a protocol in place to ensure continued safe document storage in case of sudden lockdown. Inform survivors of ways they can protect themselves, and provide small credit card-size cards listing relevant phone numbers for support"
I am a policy maker. What can I do to prevent and address violence against women during COVID-19?,"When making preparedness and response plans for the COVID-19 pandemic, include essential services for violence against women. Allocate adequate resources for services for survivors and identify ways to make them accessible – particularly in the context of measures to restrict people’s movement. Explore the use of telemedicine, digital health, or mhealth to enhance access to support and services for survivors, while ensuring this is safe for them.  Explore alternative shelters for women who may require this. Ensure that lockdown measures do not penalize women for seeking support when experiencing violence, such as by going to the police or hospital to report violence."
Has violence against women increased since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic?,"Violence against women is highly prevalent, and intimate partner violence is the most common form of violence. During health emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, violence against women tends to increase.  Whilst data are scarce, reports from across the world, including China, the United Kingdom, the United States of America, and other countries suggest a significant increase in domestic violence cases related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Reports from other countries suggest a reduction in survivors seeking services due to a combination of lockdown measures and not wanting to attend health services for fear of infection."
How does COVID-19 increase risks of violence for women?,"Stress, the disruption of social and protective networks, loss of income and decreased access to services all can exacerbate the risk of violence for women. In many countries, where people are encouraged or required to stay at home, the risk of intimate partner violence is likely to increase. Please see the following resource for more detail: https://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/publications/emergencies/COVID-19-VAW-full-text.pdf In addition, access to sexual and reproductive health services will likely become more limited. Other services, such as hotlines, crisis centers, shelters, legal aid, and protection services, may also be reduced, making it difficult for women to access the few sources of help that would usually be available."
Who is most vulnerable?,"Women who are displaced, who are migrants or refugees, and those living in conflict-affected areas, older women and women with disabilities are particularly at risk of violence and are likely to be disproportionately affected by violence during COVID-19."
Why should I care about violence against women during COVID-19?,"Violence against women is a grave violation of women’s human rights, no matter when, where, or how it takes place. There are many forms of violence against women, which have many potential negative health consequences for women and their children.  Violence against women can result in injuries and serious physical, mental, sexual and reproductive health problems, including sexually transmitted infections, HIV, and unplanned pregnancies. In extreme cases, violence against women can result in death. The effects of violence are very often long-lived. Violence – in all its forms – can have an impact on a woman’s well-being throughout the rest of her life. This is unacceptable, and the risks of violence that women and their children face during the current COVID-19 crisis cannot be ignored. When we are able to prevent violence, or to support women survivors of violence, we help to safeguard women’s human rights, and promote physical and mental health and well-being for women throughout their lives. This also helps to alleviate pressure on already stretched essential public services, including the health system."
